Back when I started uni, I bought a new <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2886" target="_blank">Asus A6J laptop</a>. It was one of the first laptops available with a dual core CPU (Core Duo, not Core 2 Duo) and decently powerful graphics (ATI X1600).<br />The A6J  is very dated now and weighing in at <span id="intelliTxt"> 2.85kg, its not very portable by today's standard (considering my <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html" target="_blank">Toshiba Portege</a> weighs just 1.13kg).</span> <br />A couple of years after I bought it, I got sick of carrying it around, so I bought an Asus EeePc as a replacement for uni, so the A6J stayed at home and was rarely used - it was just a spare for a long time.<br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Up until recently, I was using I used it as a (stationary) desktop replacement at work but I now have a new job where I am provided a  Macbook Pro so this old machine is now spare once again. This with the recent release of <a href="http://xbmc.org/natethomas/2012/03/24/xbmc-11-0-eden/" target="_blank">XBMC 11 Eden</a>, I thought I may as well re-purpose it as a permanent HTPC.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I considered quite a few options, such as running Arch Linux, OpenElec or Ubuntu with XBMC installed, or going with the recently improved XBMCbuntu (formerly known as XBMC Live).</span><br /><br /><h4>    <b><span id="intelliTxt">XBMCbuntu</span></b></h4><span id="intelliTxt">I downloaded the iso and had a bit of a play. I love how it boots directly into XBMC without the need to startup Unity or anything like that, although it does let you exit to the login screen and select either "XBMCbuntu" (LXDE) or "OpenBox" which is nice.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Once it had booted, it behaved so slow! I figured it mustn't have the correct drivers installed, so I tried to use the restricted drivers from the repo and after hitting quite a few problems I consulted the AMD site.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">The <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=2.4.1.3.12&amp;lang=English" target="_blank">AMD site explains</a> that my ATI X1600 is now "legacy" and is supported by the ATI Catalyst 9.3 proprietary linux driver.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">So I downloaded that and yet again hit a bunch of other issues.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I spent a fair portion of the day battling with this and couldn't help but think back to how easy Ubuntu Desktop handled all this, so I thought I'd just give that another go.</span><br /><br /><h4>     <b><span id="intelliTxt">Ubuntu Desktop + XBMC</span></b></h4><span id="intelliTxt">I downloaded the Ubuntu 11.10 iso and installed that over the top of XBMCbuntu and </span><span id="intelliTxt">configured the user account as 'xbmc' and to automatically login at startup.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I then followed the <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Installing_XBMC_for_Linux" target="_blank">instructions to install XBMC from their PPA</a>. I did a quick update, installed SSH, reconfigured grub to auto-boot in 1 second (instead of 10) and rebooted the machine.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">When I launched XBMC, it was perfect!</span><span id="intelliTxt"> It was very snappy and there was no lag whatsoever.</span><span id="intelliTxt">&nbsp;</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I noticed that the power menu was missing the shutdown options that were in XBMCbuntu and that the suspend option did not work.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">After a bit if research, I found a <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Suspend_and_wake_in_Ubuntu" target="_blank">wiki page</a> that explains how to modify <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">policykit</span> to allow xbmc access to all the power functions.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">With this change, shutdown, suspend and hibernate were all working great.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I had already configured Wake-On-Lan in the past, so all that I needed to do was setup the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.android.remote&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy54Ym1jLmFuZHJvaWQucmVtb3RlIl0." target="_blank">Android XBMC remote app</a> on my phone. After configuring the app with the laptops IP address, MAC address, etc. I was now able to use the "Turn your XBMC's Power On" button from the mobile app to fire up the laptop.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Of course to actually allow control of XBMC I needed to go into the settings screen and enable control via HTTP, etc. </span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">So now I can power up the laptop and shut it down from my phone, but when it boots, I am brought into a Unity environment. In the past I would add XBMC to the startup applications, but with XBMC Eden, there is a better way.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">XBMC Eden adds it self to the choice of desktop environments from the login screen (in other words, you get a choice: Unity or straight into XBMC like the live cd).</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Unfortunately it doesn't remember the last choice with XBMC, so if I boot straight into it and then shut it down, next time it will still automatically boot in to Unity.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I then came across an <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoLogin#For_Ubuntu_10.04_.28Lucid_Lynx.29" target="_blank">Ubuntu community page</a> that pointed in the direction the the LightDM config file. (LightDM is the thing that manages the login screen).</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I opened '</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</span>' and saw this line:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">user-session=ubuntu</blockquote><br />I replaced the '<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ubuntu</span>' part of this line with '<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">XBMC</span>', rebooted and low and behold, it booted straight into XBMC!<br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I now have a fully functional HTPC that I can completely control from my phone.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">The only things left to do now are configure my media sources, install some plugins and maybe play with some new skins.</span>

    Very useful post, Steven.<br /><br />Are you able to use your phone as a mouse and keyboard outside the XBMC GUI too?<br /><br />I have XBMCbuntu 11 installed on my HTPC, which I control through my android phone over HTTP. The problem I&#39;m facing is that if I ever want to get out of XBMC and go into the OS, the HTTP server that was accepting commands from my phone, stops working, and I&#39;m left without an input device. :-(<br /><br />(I don&#39;t have a keyboard or mouse connected to the HTPC.)<br /><br />Do you have any suggestions that I could try?

    Hi Ozair, thanks for the feedback!<br /><br />I know what you mean, there are a couple of things that would work, but I&#39;ll admit, they are not perfect solutions. I guess it also depends on why you want to leave the XBMC UI too.<br /><br />If you enable/install the VNC server on your HTPC, there are a number of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=vnc&amp;c=apps" rel="nofollow">free VNC clients for android</a>, you&#39;d just have to pick the one that you like the best. I&#39;ve used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wyse.pocketcloudfree&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS53eXNlLnBvY2tldGNsb3VkZnJlZSJd" rel="nofollow">PocketCloud</a> in the past because it supports RDP too, and it was pretty good.<br />This can be a little difficult from a phone screen, but it does work ok, especially on a LAN.<br /><br />If the reason for leaving XBMC is to launch something like VLC (maybe because a particular media type isn&#39;t supported by XBMC) there are some <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.peterbaldwin.client.android.vlcremote&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5wZXRlcmJhbGR3aW4uY2xpZW50LmFuZHJvaWQudmxjcmVtb3RlIl0." rel="nofollow">VLC remote control apps for android</a>, but I haven&#39;t really experimented with them yet.<br /><br />If you want to copy files, kick off a download or something like that, the most common thing I do is use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.connectbot&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">ConnectBot</a> for android to SSH onto it. I find typing on a phone is pretty easy compared to navigating a UI from a phone for console related tasks like cp, wget, etc.<br /><br />There are also a number of official and <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Unofficial_add-on_repositories" rel="nofollow">unofficial</a> add-ons and &quot;programs&quot; for XBMC to do non-standard things, like games, etc. which I would like to play with one day.<br /><br />Hope that helps, I&#39;d be interested to know what you end up using :) Cheers
