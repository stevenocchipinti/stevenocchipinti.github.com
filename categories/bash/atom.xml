    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By default, the <code>sudo</code> command does not pass your current shell environment to
the new process.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve added the function below to my bash configuration which will gives me an
<code>esudo</code> command. This command works much like <code>sudo</code> but it will pass my current
environment to the new process.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">function esudo { sudo -E bash -c "$*"; }
</code></pre>

<p>If you use a ruby version manager, you&rsquo;ll know that they generally rely on
environment variables, so <code>rvm</code> provide the <code>rvmsudo</code> command for this purpose.
I&rsquo;ve since switched to <code>chruby</code> and I couldn&rsquo;t seem to find an equivalent, but
this has solved the issue for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s so easy to write little scripts and execute them at a later time with
the standard command-line tooling available in unix-like operating systems, but
if you plan on having them execute while you are out and about, it would be nice
to get a notification on your phone that it worked (or didn&rsquo;t work).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re happy with a simple email notification, then luckily this can be done
with one simple line of code!</p>

<p>On a mac:
<code>sh
echo "Hello" | mail -s "Your alert" to-addr@example.com -f from-addr@example.com
</code></p>

<p>On *nix:
<code>sh
echo "Hello" | mail -s "Your alert" to-addr@example.com -aFrom:from-addr@example.com

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In ruby, the <code>||=</code> operator will assign a given value to a variable, if that
variable does not already have a value.
For example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby default_value.rb">puts foo  # =&gt; nil
foo ||= "bar"
puts foo  # =&gt; "bar"
foo ||= "baz"
puts foo  # =&gt; "bar"
</code></pre>

<p>This will assign <code>"bar"</code> to <code>foo</code>, unless <code>foo</code> is already set.
In other words, it will make <code>"bar"</code> the <em>default value</em> of <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>I recently had to do this is bash, and it turns out bash has similar
functionality. This is the bash equivalent:</p>

<pre><code class="bash default_value.sh">echo $FOO  # =&gt; ""
export FOO=${FOO:-"bar"}
echo $FOO  # =&gt; "bar"
export FOO=${FOO:-"baz"}
echo $FOO  # =&gt; "bar"

    <updated>2013-06-08T15:27:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/06/removing-previously-printed-lines</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote small <a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/tramtracker">Ruby Gem</a> that provides a command line interface to Melbourne&rsquo;s <a href="http://yarratrams.com.au/tramtracker">TramTracker service</a>.</p>

<p>One main feature I wanted was to allow the script to poll TramTracker on a regular basis.<br/>
In the past, I used the command line utility watch to achieve this, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to enforce a &ldquo;max iterations&rdquo; option.
If it gets forgotten about in the background, TramTracker will eventually block that IP address!</p>

<p>So I turned to Ruby. Now instead of printing the same block of text over and over again and filling up the terminal, I thought it would be better to just have that text overwrite itself in place.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll outline a couple of ways of achieving this.</p>

<h2>Using the \b (backspace) character</h2>

<p>Printing a \b character does a similar thing as pressing backspace, except instead of removing the character, it nondestructively shifts the cursor back which allows you to then overwrite previously written characters. This is really simple to use and is great for little &ldquo;progress&rdquo; spinners.<br/>
For example, a character that cycles through <code>|</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>\</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">puts "foo\b"
# =&gt; foo
puts "foo\bx"
# =&gt; fox
puts "foo\b\b\bbar"
# =&gt; bar
1.step {|i| sleep 0.2; print "\b" + "|/-\\"[i%4] }
# =&gt; Cheesy, old-school spinner
</code></pre>

<p>There are two main shortfalls with this approach, one is that it only works on a single line and two is that if you want to overwrite lots of characters, you&rsquo;d need just as many <code>\b</code> characters (you would probably introduce a loop).</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">puts "foo\n\b\b\bbar"
# =&gt; foo\nbar
</code></pre>

<h2>Using the \r (carriage return) character</h2>

<p>To avoid having to repeat just as many <code>\b</code> characters, a simple alternative would be to return the cursor to the start of the line and write over the top of the existing characters. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">100.times {|p| print "\rDownloading %#{p+1}..."; sleep 1}
</code></pre>

<p>This approach still won&rsquo;t work across multiple lines, but it has another subtle shortfall too, it doesn&rsquo;t clear the entire line. For example:</p>

<pre><code>puts "foo\rp"
# =&gt; poo
</code></pre>

<p>A common work around for this is to pad the end of the string with spaces, but there are better ways (keep reading ;) )</p>

<h2>Using curses</h2>

<p>The most common answer to overwriting characters across multiple lines, is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)">curses</a>.
Curses allows you to pick exactly with character you want to update and makes <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=command+line+curses&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.47534661,d.aGc&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=679&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=r0WzUbyWF4T-iAfn8IH4DA">menu driven Text User Interfaces</a> (TUI&rsquo;s) easier to develop.
Ruby happens to have a <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/curses/rdoc/Curses.html">curses module</a> built in to its standard library, which provides a simple API, for example:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">setpos(lines/2, cols/2) # Start in the middle
addstr("Hello world")
</code></pre>

<p>I created a more complete (simple) example of using curses in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/stevenocchipinti/5703381">gist here</a>.</p>

<p>Curses is pretty good for this sort of stuff, it gives you a lot for free.
The thing that I didn&rsquo;t like about using the curses library was that when it initialises, it clears the screen.
This behaviour suits a TUI, and the old contents is still restored when you return, but I was being picky and didn&rsquo;t want that.</p>

<h2>Using individual cursor movement characters</h2>

<p>This last option is the most fundamental of the bunch. Terminals generally support characters that will allow you to move the cursor around at will and would be the basis of things like curses, although not as commonly used. Here are the most common characters to move the cursor around:</p>

<pre><code>\033[&lt;L&gt;;&lt;C&gt;H # Move the cursor to line L, column C
\033[&lt;N&gt;A     # Move the cursor up N lines
\033[&lt;N&gt;B     # Move the cursor down N lines
\033[&lt;N&gt;C     # Move the cursor forward N columns
\033[&lt;N&gt;D     # Move the cursor backward N columns
\033[2J       # Clear the screen, move to (0,0)
\033[K        # Erase to end of line
</code></pre>

<p>You can read more about these &ldquo;escape sequences&rdquo; <a href="http://www.linuxselfhelp.com/howtos/Bash-Prompt/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO-6.html#ss6.2">here</a>.
I ended up using the <code>\033[K</code> (&ldquo;Erase to end of line&rdquo;) and the <code>\033[A</code> (&ldquo;Move the cursor up&rdquo;) <a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/tramtracker/blob/master/lib/formatters/polling_formatter.rb">characters in my TramTracker gem</a> and it worked a treat!</p>

<p>Now go and make a cool retro user interface! :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Every time I go on holiday, I end up writing the same bash script! ... I know, how nerdy is that, I code on holidays.<br /><br />I really should save the script and bring it with me each time, instead I just re-invent the wheel everytime, so I thought I would write a quick post to record it for next time.<br />Luckily it's a really simple script to write, all it does is move the photos from my camera's memory card to the laptop HDD, but it puts them in a sub-directory for that particular day, then sorts the files into a 'jpg' or 'raw' sub-directory.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4453912.js"></script>The script is quite dumb, it just creates a directory for the current date. On one of the trips, I had the script pull the date the photo was taken from the EXIF information, but when a series of photos goes over mid-night, it splits them up and I didn't really like that.
