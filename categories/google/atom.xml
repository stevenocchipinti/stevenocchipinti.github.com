I regularly attend <a href="http://ruby.org.au/" target="_blank"><i>RORO</i> - The Ruby on Rails Oceania</a> meetups.<br />They currently occur on the last Thursday of every month and so naturally I put the event in my calendar. I added the usual details and then selected the "repeat" option and set it to repeat monthly by the day of the week.<br /><br />This worked well for a while, until one day when I rocked up and it wasn't on.<br />A later realised that in that particular month there were 5 Thursdays instead of 4 and my calendar event was actually set to repeat <i>"Monthly on the fourth Thursday"</i>.<br />It turns out that the interface Google provide to set recurring events does not allow you to change this.. or at least not intuitively.<br /><br />After some searching around I found a few solutions:<br /><br /><br /><b>Use English!</b><br /><br />The simplest way is to just write out the event in plain English. For example:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">RORO at Inspire9, Richmond on the last Thursday of every month</div></blockquote>This will create an event called "RORO at Inspire9, Richmond", with the location field set to "Inspire9, Richmond" and the repetition set to <i>"Monthly on the last Thursday".</i><br /><br /><br /><b>Start repeating from an appropriate month</b><br /><br />Another fairly easy way is to find a month that actually has 5 Thursdays and make the event start from there. This will set the recurrence to repeat <i>"Monthly on the last Thursday"</i>, instead of <i>"Monthly on the fourth Thursday"</i>.<br /><br /><br /><b>Hack the ICS</b><br /><br />This solution is probably the hardest, but because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar" target="_blank">iCalendar</a> format does support this, you could write the code manually. To do this you would have to export the calendar to a file, hack it and import it back.<br />While it's nice to know this, seems like more effort that just typing what you want in English!<br /><br /><br /><b>A better solution</b><br /><br />.. would be if Google provided an additional option in the little "repeat" popup to allow this!<br /><br />Or maybe the RORO organiser should maintain there own calendar feed that we could all subscribe to. This would also mean that if a particular meetup was moved or cancelled, all the subscribers calendars would automatically be updated!

So I started my new job and they use Google Apps!<br />Initially I thought this was fantastic, until I realized that because I also use Google Apps for my personal email, I couldn't have 2 simultaneous gmail logins (by default). <br /><br />I found some out-of-date firefox plugins to work around this, but they weren't very nice, so I just pinned my work gmail as an app tab and left it at that.<br /><br />Then I noticed a co-worker had about 3 gmail app tabs, and too my surprise it wasnt some dodgy plugin that allowed this, but an official Google solution!<br /><br />The answer:<br /><a href="http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=181599">http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?answer=181599</a><br /><br />This allows you to have multiple Google accounts signed in at once, with a few caveats.<br />Once enabled, the first account you sign into is your "primary" and behaves normal, the subsequent logins will only work on particular products (gmail is the obvious one) but will work in isolation to your other logins.<br /><br />I chose my personal account as my primary because things like blogger do not work as a secondary account.. and I don't have a work-blogger account :P<br /><br />This <strike>is</strike> was only really an issue if you want to use a single browser on a computer, as my phones gmail app handles multiple logins fine.

    Hehehe... you know what the funny thing is... I was helping my mum with this *today*... but I went the lame, most basic solution: adding multiple POP accounts and using labels. She finds it very easy to use :-)

    lol! cool :)<br />At least she uses labels and checks multiple accounts, I know alot of &quot;mums&quot; that struggle with the basics - thats quite advanced for some.<br />I considered auto forwarding everything, but I did want the rest of the domain benefits (sharing calendars, etc.)
