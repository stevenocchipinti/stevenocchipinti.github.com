<div>I've had an interest in electronics since a very young age, but I never really went further than building simple circuits as a kid and learning the theory and following diagrams through school.<br />There's always the odd repair job, and plenty of theoretical knowledge from family, friends and university, but I wouldn't be able to design the electronics of anything complex.<br /><br />A little while back, a <a href="http://michael.chandler.id.au/" target="_blank">friend of mine</a> got an email from <a href="http://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> with suggested meetups. One of them was the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hackduino-Electronics-Meetup-Group" target="_blank">Melbourne Hackduino</a> meetup. <br />So he forwarded it on to our group of friends and a few of us went along to check it out. I've always wanted to play with a microprocessor, but never really put the time aside for it. Being a software developer there was always this barrier between the programs I write and making them do something in the real world.<br /><br />Well, in the last week that barrier has been lifted! The meetup was great and hearing about other people's hobbies and projects provides plenty of motivation! We heard stories about everything from people trying to optimize solar hot water systems to building full size mechanical avatars. It was a lot of fun!<br /><br /><a href="http://au.linkedin.com/pub/mark-butt/28/507/539" target="_blank">Mark Butt</a>, the organiser of the event gave us a presentation of <a href="http://www.springrocket.com.au/portfolio/" target="_blank">some of the cool things he has done in the past</a>, such as an arduino powered bar counter top that detects what drink you put on it and a run down of some of the things he plans on doing in the future, all very cool!<br /><br />One really nice bonus was the generous offering from <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/" target="_blank">Freetronics</a>. There were a few people from Freetronics at the event and other than being very knowledgeable, they brought a big bunch of assorted hardware to give away! They had everything from RGB LEDs to full blown Arduino boards.   I was lucky enough to score an <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/products/ethermega-arduino-mega-2560-compatible-with-onboard-ethernet#.UA3bC3AwyGo" target="_blank">EtherMega 2650</a>, which from what I can tell is a beefed up Arduino with an Ethernet port (with power over Ethernet) and a MicroSD card reader. Some of my friends got a <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/products/lcd-keypad-shield#.UA4RrXAwyGp" target="_blank">LCD shield</a> that can display 2 rows of 16 characters and has a few buttons on board. For those that aren't up with the lingo, a shield is an attachment for a standard Arduino board to add functionality.<br /><br />Together we had enough hardware to be able to make something cool! :-)<br />Needless to say after some great conversations about hardware hacking and being given some gear to get going, we were all pretty keen to get started hacking, so on the following Saturday three of us got together for a hack night.<br />The guys came around that night, we ordered pizzas and worked through the night till about 5:30 AM!   We had one experienced hardware guy, <a href="http://anthony.hacd.com.au/" target="_blank">Anthony</a>, but the other two of us, <a href="http://michael.chandler.id.au/" target="_blank">Michael</a> and I, were completely new to this, but between Anthony, the sample code that comes with the IDE and the Internet we picked it up pretty fast!<br />By the end of the night we had the first version of CarDuino!<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/HACD/CarDuino" target="_blank">CarDuino</a> is a simple game where you hold the screen in portrait orientation and move your car from side to side to avoid obstacles.  It's a very simple game, and we have plenty more features in mind for the future, but it was a great first project!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://3.gvt0.com/vi/JzRWstCstas/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/JzRWstCstas&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/JzRWstCstas&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div><br />After sleeping in till about lunch time there next day, I wanted to put my EtherMega to use, so I spent the rest of the day fiddling with that.   With network access, power over Ethernet and a card reader, this is a perfect platform for controlling things via a web interface. As my background is web development, this was right up my alley!   Using various sample code, I put together a <a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/ArduinoWebServer" target="_blank">really basic web server</a> that can respond to different requests and serve files from its built in memory card reader.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ezXsvJSsgHc/UAvmjO-JnGI/AAAAAAAAAKE/oZ6v5viAgzQ/20120722_213551.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ezXsvJSsgHc/UAvmjO-JnGI/AAAAAAAAAKE/oZ6v5viAgzQ/20120722_213551.png" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">My Freetronics EtherMega 2560 serving files from the memory card on a webserver!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />In just a few days, we went from no Arduino experience to a working project (or two). Especially with basic programming experience, the entry level for getting into Arduino is really low. When you buy (or build) a board and download the software, you have enough sample code with the IDE to make things happen, and you can get a lot done by simply copying and pasting!<br /><br />&nbsp;I recommend having a play with this stuff, its really fun and more than likely, one day you will come across a problem that you will be able to solve with an Arduino!</div>

If you saw my <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/11/13-core-i7-samsung-series-9-ultrabook.html">last post</a>, you would have seen that I recently bought a 13" Samsung Series 9 ultrabook - I still think these machines are stunning!<br /><br /><br /><b>The problem</b><br /><br />There are a couple of little complaints floating around about the Samsung, like heat output, easily finger-printed chasis, but none of these <i>really</i> bother me, but there is one thing that does... alot... and its the wifi!<br /><br />I could be using the laptop in the next room from my wireless router and it would dropout completely or go incredibly slow, if I move to the other side of the house where my bedroom is, my phone will have full reception, but this laptop will not see the wifi network at all - and this in unacceptable.<br /><br /><br /><b>The transition</b><br /><br />After returning the laptop (twice) I eventually asked for my money back so I could go purchase my second preference - the Macbook Air.<br />Unfortunately, the shop would not give me a full refund and could only offer me a credit note.<br />I tried to explain that no other units in store could offer me the same specs that I was after, the Samsung's best competition is the Macbook Air, but as they couldn't help me I asked to see what else they have in a light 13".<br /><br />The sales guy showed me an <a href="http://zenbook.asus.com/" target="_blank">Asus Zenbook</a> and a new product which had just arrived to their store, the <a href="http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/portege/z830/" target="_blank">Toshiba Portege Z830</a>.<br />I was lucky enough to be the first to see this at their store and even got to open the display model and check it out.<br /><br />The decision between the two was tough!<br />The Asus Zenbook had a very sturdy exterior and had a similar tapered  design to the Macbook Air while the Toshiba Portege had a business feel  to it, but was slightly lighter and thinner. <br />They were both similarly spec'ed with Core i5's, 128GB SSD's and 4GB of RAM, but there were a few notable differences between them.<br /><br />Although the Asus Zenbook does not have a backlit keyboard and has reduced size ports, it does has a higher resolution screen than the Samsung and Toshiba, but like the Mac it's a glossy screen. I personally prefer matte screens because even in brightly lit areas or even outside in direct sunlight, the screen is alot more visible. <br /><br />The Toshiba Portege has a matte screen, backlit keyboard, has a full size HDMI port, VGA port, Ethernet port, 2x USB 2.0 ports, 1x USB 3.0 port and SD card reader and its thinner and lighter. Toshiba also give a 3 year warranty out-of-the-box with this model.<br />The screen is quite a bit more flimsy than the others and the system fan does tend to groan a little (compared to the Samsung at least), but this is probably all I can complain about.<br /><br /><br /><b>The solution</b><br /><br />I took a day to think about it and eventually made up my mind for the Portege.<br />In the US, there is an i7 variety with 6GB of RAM, but I don't really want to wait for it to get here.<br />I took a look at a <a href="http://ark.intel.com/compare/54616,56858" target="_blank">comparison</a> between the i7 from the Samsung and the i5 from the Toshiba, and while I would have paid the extra for the i7, I don't think I'll really notice the difference in most scenarios.<br /><br />It seems I am not the only one who ended up swapping a Samsung Series 9 for a Toshiba Portege Z830 either, I came across this <a href="http://thessdreview.com/our-reviews/sata-3/toshiba-z830-13-3-ultrabook-laptop-review-toshiba-creates-one-amazing-ultrabook/" target="_blank">blog post</a> where the author goes into more detail and provides results of quite specific tests.<br /><br />In the end I paid $1539 for the laptop with a 3 year warranty and then an extra $79 to upgrade it to 6GB of RAM.<br />While it's no Samsung Series 9, its pretty nice and the cut in performance saved me a little more than $600.

    Nice post Steve...<br /><br />If you dig a little deeper you will notice that I was the only reviewer to identify the severe Series 9 wifi problems initially, problems which are still prevalent today:<br /><br />http://thessdreview.com/our-reviews/the-samsung-series-9-13-900x3a-a01ca-review-this-may-be-a-work-of-art-almost/

    Thanks! I appreciate the feedback :)<br /><br />I did read that post too and while it did scare me, I immediately asked a friend (who also owns one) if he had experienced the same issues, which he didn&#39;t - so with mixed feedback and such a nice machine, I just had to try.<br /><br />After some issues, I ended up doing the same wifi speed comparisons as you with other laptops in the house and got mixed results - which unfortunately I could not prove to the store at the time I returned it.<br /><br />Needless to say, like yourself, I am very disappointed as I started to become attached to the very well built machine.<br /><br />It&#39;s a real shame, but the Toshiba is going strong so far :)

    Nice call Steven and thats coming from the site owner at &#39;that blogpost&#39; eheheh.  I went through 4 x Series 9 laptops before getting the Z830, mine being an i7.  IMHO, the lid isn&#39;t flimsy, but rather, reflective of just how thin it is. It is the thinnest ultra on the market.<br /><br />I as well have read all the comments regarding fan issues but have yet to be bothered by mine whatsoever.  I expected such with a laptop that is this thin in any case.<br /><br />Again nice post!

    Haha, thanks Les :) Means a lot to me!<br /><br />Wow, you went through 4! I went through 2 and the shop were getting quite annoyed with me, lol.<br /><br />After using the screen for a while now, I do actually like the thickness of it, and the fan noise is only evident when there is no other background noise around (like late at night).<br /><br />My complaints with the Toshiba are very minor, but I am very happy with this machine.<br /><br />As I run 2 operating systems, one day I&#39;ll have to consider upgrading the SSD and I&#39;m sure your site will be of great help to me when that time comes!<br /><br />Thanks for the comments :)

    I know it&#39;s too late for you now (congrats on the Toshiba, looks like a nice machine!) but I recently saw this on the Samsung Q&amp;A website, and thought it might help other people Googling for this issue.  I haven&#39;t confirmed that it works, but another commenter on the Q&amp;A site did.<br /><br />From: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/allQuestion.do?prd_mdl_name=NP900X3A<br /><br /><br />A : I can&#39;t speak for the Broadcom WiFi card, but for the Intel card (and perhaps also for the Broadcom card), the issue is with the default power management settings. If the laptop works well when plugged in and using the &quot;Samsung Optimized&quot; power plan but works poorly when not plugged in, this is your issue. To fix it, go to Control Panel (View by: Small icons) *or* right click on the battery icon in the system tray area, then select Power Options. For the current plan, click Change plan settings, then click Change advanced power settings. Expand Wireless Adapter Settings, expand Power Saving Mode, then set Plugged in: to &quot;Maximum Performance&quot; (see screenshot). This is the only setting that works properly--I&#39;ve tried all of them. Make this change for all of the power plans, or at least all of the ones you intend to use.

    How do you feel about the performance with Ubuntu? I just bought a Portege Z830 fully-loaded and it seems to lock up at least a couple of times a day on heavy IO tasks. That may be just because I&#39;m running a Wubi install though (couldn&#39;t wait to get Ubuntu installed).

    Hi Mike,<br /><br />I have had a great experience with Ubuntu.<br />I&#39;m running Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome Shell and have never really seen any lag or lockups.<br />I haven&#39;t made any optimizations or anything, its all just stock standard.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t tried Wubi on this machine, I have partitioned my 128GB SSD down the middle, which doesn&#39;t leave alot of space per OS.<br />I am even considering taking Windows off, considering I barely ever use it these days.

Back in my first year of uni, I bought one of the early Core Duo (not Core 2 Duo) 15" Asus laptops which at the time was great and it had a decent graphics card for games, etc.<br />Roughly 6 years later, its showing its age. The battery lasts less than an hour now, it weighs about 3kg not including the adapter and performance is lacking compared to todays technology.<br /><br />After a recent shoulder injury and a busy week that involved me carrying my laptop from place to place, I decided it was time to reward myself with an early Christmas present and buy a new machine.<br /><br />My requirements were:<br /><ul><li>13" screen</li><li>As thin and as light as possible to aid portability</li><li>Powerful enough to do almost anything my daily activities could involve</li><li>&lt;~ $2000 </li></ul>I compared as many of these 13" <i>"ultrabooks"</i> as I could and before long I had created a shortlist of my top 3 - which included an Asus u-Series, a Macbook Air and a Samsung Series 9.<br /><br /><br /><b>Asus u-Series</b><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.asus.com.au/Notebooks/Superior_Mobility/U36SD/#specifications" target="_blank">Asus machines</a>, as usual, had a very good bang-for-buck, a nice thickness of 19mm and unlike most others, some models had full size video output and ethernet plugs.<br />While the price and size were right, the highest spec'ed machines were not quite as impressive as its competition. If budget was the number one concern, the Asus u-Series and Zenbook range offer pretty good value.<br /><br /><br /><b>Macbook Air</b><br /><br />I have never been a <i>"Mac person"</i> due to the traditional heavy pricing and proprietary nature of alot of their products, but these days (after some convincing) I believe the hardware and even price does have a surprisingly strong position in the competition.<br />The <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_pro" target="_blank">13" Macbook Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/macbookair/specs.html" target="_blank">Macbook Air</a> both had very good specs to offer for around the $2000 price tag, both with Core i7's, 4-8GB RAM and SSD's, not to mention pretty attractive packaging.<br />After seeing a Macbook Air up close, I really liked how the thickest point is about 17mm or so at the back but it tapers off to next to nothing at the front.<br /><br />So the model I chose for comparison purposes was worth $1928.99 and had the following specs:<br /><ul><li>1.8GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7</li><li>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM</li><li>256GB flash storage</li><li>Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter ($30)</li></ul>I don't like the very proprietary DisplayPort and its $30 adapters, but its not too bad as almost <i>everyone </i>at my office uses a Mac so finding a spare adapter when needed wouldn't be too hard (I guess popularity offsets proprietary-ness).<br /><br />The operating system did not bother me too much either as I intended to be running Linux as my primary OS anyway, but having a Mac would give me more familiarity with OSX which would be helpful considering its popularity in my line of work.<br /><br />The minor annoyances would be: expensive adapters for video and ethernet ports, unfamiliar keyboard layout (command key where alt should be, etc), non-upgradeable ram, glossy screen, etc. - but those are pretty minor.<br /><br /><br /><b>Samsung Series 9</b><br /><br />I found these ultrabooks to have a very unique look and one of the first well thought out, thin designs that are not just another Mac look-a-like.<br />The sales pitch always includes a spiel about its "Duralumin"- which is a light and strong material used in aircrafts and while it looks stunning and adds sophistication and uniqueness to the overall design on the unit, this material along with the black plastic are both fingerprint magnets!<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/pc-peripherals/notebook-pc/thin-light/NP900X3A-A03AU/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail&amp;tab=specification" target="_blank">specs of the Series 9 unit</a> I used for comparison (and ultimately bought) was quite good:<br /><ul><li>1.5GHz Core i7</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>256GB SSD</li><li>Micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter ($15) </li></ul>Initially I thought 1.5 GHz was kinda low, but after conversations with quite a few people and some <a href="http://ark.intel.com/compare/54616" target="_blank">research</a>, this speed is its sort-of <i>"resting"</i> frequency and will automatically scale up to 2.6GHz when required.<br /><br />The one big catch with this system is the RRP of ~$2700, while most Aussie shops sold them for ~$2500. This made me consider the Mac even more!<br /><br />But during my research I saw <a href="https://www.mln.com.au/" target="_blank">MLN</a>'s price drop down to a much more attractive $1997 and immediately rang them to find out more details and how long the special would last. It turns out that Samsung are starting to phase them out of stores (presumably to make way for a new product next year) and naturally they had sold alot of units and only had a few left.<br /><br />I did a bit more research and found that to save space, the ports are hidden behind very aircraft-like flaps, but as with the Mac, they are reduced size ports.<br />The video output is provided in the form of a micro-HDMI port - which is at least a more common format and I don't need to go through apple.com.<br />The other space-saving trade-off was a (sadly) proprietary ethernet port that comes bundled with an adapter to convert it to RJ45 - but unlike the Mac where you need to buy a USB network adapter, this actually has the network card built in, it just has an unusual plug - which I don't intend to use much anyway.<br /><br />Another plus is this model comes with 1x USB 3.0 port (and a 2.0 port) which is great considering the speeds my brother gets with his USB 3.0 flash drive.<br /><br />So I went to MLN and inspected the unit up close and what eventually made my decision for the Samsung was that for about the same price I get a machine with double the RAM (handy for VMs), a windows licence for portable gaming and a bunch of freebies from MLN including the HDMI to micro-HDMI cable, a set of Sennheiser headphones and a padded sleeve to carry it.<br /><br />I was able to get the cable and sleeve free because I opted to purchase the extended 3 year pickup warranty for an additional $180ish and the headphones were a Christmas present :)<br /><br />Initial impressions are very positive, the screen is incredibly bright and vibrant and with a smooth matte finish, I have had no issues using it outdoors.<br />The backlit keyboard is quite nice too, although the brightness of this light is controlled via windows drivers, so in linux (at this stage) I cant control its brightness.<br />The touchpad is large and seems to employ the same technique as the Mac Magic Mouse where there is one click-able button (the lower part of the pad) and depending on where your finger is when you click determines a right or left mouse click and once again, this doesnt work in Linux out of the box, but the standard 2 finger tap works as per normal.<br />Using Ubuntu 11.10 the rest of the hardware works out of the box, so no need to fiddle with drivers for network, graphics, webcam, etc.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with my purchase and its a huge step up from my old 15.4" 3kg laptop!

In the initial R&amp;D stages for our <a href="http://tank.stevenocchipinti.com/">Tank Project</a> we have to work out the most suitable way to interface from software to hardware - which I have never done before!<br /><br /><br /><b>The parallel port</b><br /><br />One of those options is to use the parallel port, which allows us 8 data pins that we can use for controlling motors, etc.<br />The layout of a parallel port is quite easy, there are 8 "D" pins for data with 8 matching "Ground" pins (shown in green below).<br /><br /><div style="padding: 32px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://linuxgazette.net/118/misc/chong/parallel_port_diagram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">  <img border="0" height="214" src="http://linuxgazette.net/118/misc/chong/parallel_port_diagram.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><b>The test rig</b><br /><br />As the output from the parallel port is about 5 volts, I though LED's were a suitable was of testing this out, so I went searching through our garage to find a parallel cable from an old printer and a bunch of LED's.<br />I found a bunch of tristate LED's - tristates have 3 legs instead of 2 and provide 2 different colors depending on which legs have power to them.<br />For example, if the circuit connects the left leg and the middle leg, it produces green light, whereas the right leg and middle leg produce red light.<br />Soldering 4 of these LEDs to a board meant I could join all the middle legs together which would be what I connect the ground wire from the parallel port to and the other 8 legs to the 8 data wires.<br /><br /><br /><b>The software</b><br /><br />In order to control when each of the data pins has power to it or not, you simply have to write 8 bits (a byte) to the parallel port where each bit corresponds to a data pin.<br />In linux this is quite simple as you can write to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/dev/port</span> just like any other file.<br />To test this out, I wrote a little Ruby script to play a fancy little sequence a few times. The code is quite simple considering some <a href="http://yueda.issp.u-tokyo.ac.jp/weda/ruby/parport.rb">other examples</a> on the net:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1274548.js"></script><br /><br /><b>The fun part!</b> <br /><br />So my computer doesn't have a parallel port, but we have some older machines that do. So I found an old pc and booted off a linux live distro that has ruby, plugged in the cable with the LEDs on it, and ran my script, and this is what happens: <br /><div style="padding: 32px; text-align: center;"><embed allowfullscreen="true" src="http://img546.imageshack.us/flvplayer.swf?f=Pjch" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="300" wmode="transparent"></embed></div><b>The conclusion</b><br /><br />This is the first time I have ever written a program that uses hardware, albeit really basic hardware, but this has a lot of potential.<br />Instead of turning on lights, this small current could trigger relays to do more exciting things, or in our case power transistors using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> to control motor speed for our tank - and its so simple!

    Maybe it&#39;s just me, but there&#39;s an elegance in seeing *bits* when so many of us work in higher level languages these days.<br /><br />Good work man!

    Thanks man :)<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t have even known how to specify bits if not for this, lol.<br /><br />Yea, don&#39;t see bits very often. I could have written this basic example in C, but because its going to be part of a web app one day, I wanted my high level comforts for later on - I&#39;m not that hardcore, lol :P
