    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>1. Download Oracle Java</h2>

<p>First you will need the official Oracle version of Java (the open source
alternatives will probably not work as well for Minecraft). I think you can
just download the runtime, but I personally opt for installing the complete
Java Development Kit (JDK).</p>

<p>You can download the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">official JDK here</a>.<br/>
If you run a RedHat based distro, there is a <code>.rpm</code>, otherwise just get the
<code>.tgz</code> for your system.</p>

<h2>2. Installing Oracle Java</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, the version of java is 7u45.<br/>
I move this <code>.tar.gz</code> file from my downloads folder to <code>/opt</code> and unzip it
there, like this:
<code>
mv ~/Downloads/jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz /opt
cd /opt
tar xzvf jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz
</code></p>

<p>This will create a new directory called <code>jdk1.7.0_45</code>.<br/>
As there is a good chance we will be updating java in the future, I create a
symlink that we can easily change to the new versions in the future like this:
<code>
ln -s jdk1.7.0_45 jdk
</code></p>

<p>Now when ever you want to find java, it will be in <code>/opt/jdk</code>.</p>

<p>All we have to do now is make the executables available on the <code>PATH</code>.<br/>
Edit your <code>.bashrc</code> (or <code>.profile</code>, etc.) and add this line:
<code>
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk/bin/
</code></p>

<h2>3. Install Minecraft</h2>

<p>Get Minecraft from the <a href="https://minecraft.net/download">official Minecraft download page</a>.
Under the &ldquo;Minecraft for Linux / Other&rdquo; there is a link to download the
official Minecraft <code>.jar</code> file.  I also put this in <code>/opt</code>:
<code>
mkdir /opt/minecraft
mv ~/Downloads/Minecraft.jar /opt/minecraft
</code></p>

<p>At this point we can start Minecraft with this:
<code>
java -jar Minecraft.jar
</code></p>

<h2>4. Setting up an Application Launcher for Gnome</h2>

<p>I use Gnome Shell and if I&rsquo;m not in a terminal, I normally use Gnome&rsquo;s
<em>Activities Overview</em> to launch apps by pressing the &lsquo;super&rsquo; key, typing
&ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; and pressing &lsquo;enter&rsquo;.</p>

<p>We want Minecraft to be installed just like any other app, so we will need to
add a launcher for Minecraft, but before we do that, we need an icon for it.
I just found one online, so lets download it to our <code>/opt/minecraft</code> directory.</p>

<pre><code>cd /opt/minecraft
wget http://images.wikia.com/yogbox/images/d/dd/Minecraft_Block.svg
</code></pre>

<p>Then to make an application launcher, you can use this:
<code>
gnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/.local/share/applications
</code></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9VnJ9K_nqQo/Un72Np6LzPI/AAAAAAAABTg/PVig82azah8/w435-h224-no">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9VnJ9K_nqQo/Un72Np6LzPI/AAAAAAAABTg/PVig82azah8/w435-h224-no</a>"></p>

<p>You can assign it the logo we downloaded earlier and use this for the command:
<code>
/opt/jdk/bin/java -jar /opt/minecraft/Minecraft.jar
</code></p>

<h2>5. Have fun!</h2>

<p>Now you can launch Minecraft just like the other apps in Gnome Shell!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/adding-network-printer-in-ubuntu-1204.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-05T04:11:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/adding-network-printer-in-ubuntu-1204</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the old days, printing was really hard in linux. It was one of the things that was a deal breaker when trying to switch from Windows for a lot of people, but when I first tried Ubuntu (probably around 2006-2007) it made all that pain go away! It was easy! A couple of clicks and you could set up a network printer and its been that easy ever since.</p>

<p>Recently Ubuntu have tried to make their settings screen a bit like a Mac, and to simplify everything they seem to be using a simplified user interface for the printer configuration too:</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx9JrDkVYrk/UB3w_5N77aI/AAAAAAAAAKY/5HHdw8ZErB0/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:37.png">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx9JrDkVYrk/UB3w_5N77aI/AAAAAAAAAKY/5HHdw8ZErB0/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:37.png</a>" title="New Settings user interface" >
<img class="center <a" src="href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xO2uGM8R36A/UB3xME_iwZI/AAAAAAAAAKg/kBFbC_MDcv8/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:55.png">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xO2uGM8R36A/UB3xME_iwZI/AAAAAAAAAKg/kBFbC_MDcv8/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:55.png</a>" title="New Printing user interface" ></p>

<p>Well this new interface doesn&rsquo;t work for me, when I try to add a network printer, I get the error message:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>FirewallD is not running. Network printer detection needs services mdns, ipp, ipp-client and samba-client enabled on firewall.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpSMga_I2I/UB3xOZVzlDI/AAAAAAAAAKo/4_KILPWTWTg/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A03%253A44.png">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpSMga_I2I/UB3xOZVzlDI/AAAAAAAAAKo/4_KILPWTWTg/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A03%253A44.png</a>" title="The error that stops me from finding my network printer" ></p>

<p>Well no matter what I did, I couldn&rsquo;t add my printer. After some googling around, I found how to get to the old user interface&hellip; which actually works!
Just type this into a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo system-config-printer
</code></pre>

<p>And you will be given this old familiar screen:</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SnoWmsgEnX0/UB3xQWJYmhI/AAAAAAAAAK4/LCbtVTqQFZE/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A04%253A55.png">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SnoWmsgEnX0/UB3xQWJYmhI/AAAAAAAAAK4/LCbtVTqQFZE/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A04%253A55.png</a>" title="The classic printing user interface&hellip; the one that works!" ></p>

<p>Clicking the big &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button in this screen and following the steps worked great for me. Another alternative is to use the CUPS web interface on <a href="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</a> but that can be a little more complicated.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[XBMC Eden + Ubuntu]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/04/xbmc-eden-ubuntu.html"/>
    <updated>2012-04-06T10:23:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/04/xbmc-eden-ubuntu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back when I started uni, I bought a new <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2886">Asus A6J laptop</a>. It was one of the first laptops available with a dual core CPU (Core Duo, not Core 2 Duo) and decently powerful graphics (ATI X1600).<br/>
The A6J  is very dated now and weighing in at 2.85kg, its not very portable by today&rsquo;s standard (considering my <a href="/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html">Toshiba Portege</a> weighs just 1.13kg).<br/>
A couple of years after I bought it, I got sick of carrying it around, so I bought an Asus EeePc as a replacement for uni, so the A6J stayed at home and was rarely used - it was just a spare for a long time.</p>

<p>Up until recently, I was using I used it as a (stationary) desktop replacement at work but I now have a new job where I am provided a  Macbook Pro so this old machine is now spare once again. This with the recent release of <a href="http://xbmc.org/natethomas/2012/03/24/xbmc-11-0-eden/">XBMC 11 Eden</a>, I thought I may as well re-purpose it as a permanent HTPC.</p>

<p>I considered quite a few options, such as running Arch Linux, OpenElec or Ubuntu with XBMC installed, or going with the recently improved XBMCbuntu (formerly known as XBMC Live).</p>

<h2>XBMCbuntu</h2>

<p>I downloaded the iso and had a bit of a play. I love how it boots directly into XBMC without the need to startup Unity or anything like that, although it does let you exit to the login screen and select either &ldquo;XBMCbuntu&rdquo; (LXDE) or &ldquo;OpenBox&rdquo; which is nice.</p>

<p>Once it had booted, it behaved so slow! I figured it mustn&rsquo;t have the correct drivers installed, so I tried to use the restricted drivers from the repo and after hitting quite a few problems I consulted the AMD site.<br/>
The <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;amp;product=2.4.1.3.12&amp;amp;lang=English">AMD site explains</a> that my ATI X1600 is now &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; and is supported by the ATI Catalyst 9.3 proprietary linux driver.<br/>
So I downloaded that and yet again hit a bunch of other issues.</p>

<p>I spent a fair portion of the day battling with this and couldn&rsquo;t help but think back to how easy Ubuntu Desktop handled all this, so I thought I&rsquo;d just give that another go.</p>

<h2>Ubuntu Desktop + XBMC</h2>

<p>I downloaded the Ubuntu 11.10 iso and installed that over the top of XBMCbuntu and configured the user account as &lsquo;xbmc&rsquo; and to automatically login at startup.<br/>
I then followed the <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Installing_XBMC_for_Linux">instructions to install XBMC from their PPA</a>. I did a quick update, installed SSH, reconfigured grub to auto-boot in 1 second (instead of 10) and rebooted the machine.</p>

<p>When I launched XBMC, it was perfect! It was very snappy and there was no lag whatsoever.<br/>
I noticed that the power menu was missing the shutdown options that were in XBMCbuntu and that the suspend option did not work.<br/>
After a bit if research, I found a <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Suspend_and_wake_in_Ubuntu">wiki page</a> that explains how to modify <code>policykit</code> to allow xbmc access to all the power functions.<br/>
With this change, shutdown, suspend and hibernate were all working great.</p>

<p>I had already configured Wake-On-Lan in the past, so all that I needed to do was setup the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.android.remote&amp;amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy54Ym1jLmFuZHJvaWQucmVtb3RlIl0.">Android XBMC remote app</a> on my phone. After configuring the app with the laptops IP address, MAC address, etc. I was now able to use the &ldquo;Turn your XBMC&rsquo;s Power On&rdquo; button from the mobile app to fire up the laptop.<br/>
Of course to actually allow control of XBMC I needed to go into the settings screen and enable control via HTTP, etc.</p>

<p>So now I can power up the laptop and shut it down from my phone, but when it boots, I am brought into a Unity environment. In the past I would add XBMC to the startup applications, but with XBMC Eden, there is a better way.<br/>
XBMC Eden adds it self to the choice of desktop environments from the login screen (in other words, you get a choice: Unity or straight into XBMC like the live cd).<br/>
Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t remember the last choice with XBMC, so if I boot straight into it and then shut it down, next time it will still automatically boot in to Unity.</p>

<p>I then came across an <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoLogin#For_Ubuntu_10.04_.28Lucid_Lynx.29">Ubuntu community page</a> that pointed in the direction the the LightDM config file. (LightDM is the thing that manages the login screen).<br/>
I opened <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code> and saw this line:</p>

<pre><code>user-session=ubuntu
</code></pre>

<p>I replaced the <code>ubuntu</code> part of this line with <code>XBMC</code>, rebooted and low and behold, it booted straight into XBMC!</p>

<p>I now have a fully functional HTPC that I can completely control from my phone.<br/>
The only things left to do now are configure my media sources, install some plugins and maybe play with some new skins.</p>

    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/02/minecraft-exception-in-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally decided to install Minecraft on my new shiny <a href="/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html">Toshiba Portege z830</a>.<br/>
Ubuntu ships with an open-source version of Java, which did run Minecraft, but the graphics were terrible, even on the lowest settings. There were artefacts everywhere!</p>

<p>So as recommended, I switched to the official JRE. Now the login screen works, but that&rsquo;s about it. After logging in, I just got a black screen and the following exception in the console:</p>

<pre><code>Exception in thread "Minecraft main thread"
java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at
net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.a(SourceFile:180) at

... 3 more
</code></pre>

<p>After discussing the problem in IRC, the solution was quite simple. It turns out <code>lwjgl</code> is a &ldquo;<em>Light Weight Java Game Library</em>&rdquo; and the version I had wasn&rsquo;t behaving.<br/>
On the advice of the helpful IRC'ers, I downloaded the latest <code>lwjgl</code> from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/">here</a> (which at time of writing is 2.8.3) to get it all to work nicely.</p>

<p>To install it, I downloaded the zip file, extracted it to a temporary directory, then copied across these files:</p>

<pre><code>cp lwjgl-2.8.3/jar/lwjgl.jar ~/.minecraft/bin
cp lwjgl-2.8.3/native/linux/* ~/.minecraft/bin/natives
</code></pre>

<p>Done! Now it works nicely.</p>
