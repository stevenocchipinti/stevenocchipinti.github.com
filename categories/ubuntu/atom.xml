    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/adding-network-printer-in-ubuntu-1204.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-05T04:11:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/adding-network-printer-in-ubuntu-1204</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the old days, printing was really hard in linux. It was one of the things that was a deal breaker when trying to switch from Windows for a lot of people, but when I first tried Ubuntu (probably around 2006-2007) it made all that pain go away! It was easy! A couple of clicks and you could set up a network printer and its been that easy ever since.</p>

<p>Recently Ubuntu have tried to make their settings screen a bit like a Mac, and to simplify everything they seem to be using a simplified user interface for the printer configuration too:</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx9JrDkVYrk/UB3w_5N77aI/AAAAAAAAAKY/5HHdw8ZErB0/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:37.png">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx9JrDkVYrk/UB3w_5N77aI/AAAAAAAAAKY/5HHdw8ZErB0/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:37.png</a>" title="New Settings user interface" >
<img class="center <a" src="href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xO2uGM8R36A/UB3xME_iwZI/AAAAAAAAAKg/kBFbC_MDcv8/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:55.png">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xO2uGM8R36A/UB3xME_iwZI/AAAAAAAAAKg/kBFbC_MDcv8/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:55.png</a>" title="New Printing user interface" ></p>

<p>Well this new interface doesn&rsquo;t work for me, when I try to add a network printer, I get the error message:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>FirewallD is not running. Network printer detection needs services mdns, ipp, ipp-client and samba-client enabled on firewall.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpSMga_I2I/UB3xOZVzlDI/AAAAAAAAAKo/4_KILPWTWTg/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A03%253A44.png">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpSMga_I2I/UB3xOZVzlDI/AAAAAAAAAKo/4_KILPWTWTg/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A03%253A44.png</a>" title="The error that stops me from finding my network printer" ></p>

<p>Well no matter what I did, I couldn&rsquo;t add my printer. After some googling around, I found how to get to the old user interface&hellip; which actually works!
Just type this into a terminal:</p>

<p><code>
sudo system-config-printer
</code></p>

<p>And you will be given this old familiar screen:</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SnoWmsgEnX0/UB3xQWJYmhI/AAAAAAAAAK4/LCbtVTqQFZE/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A04%253A55.png">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SnoWmsgEnX0/UB3xQWJYmhI/AAAAAAAAAK4/LCbtVTqQFZE/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A04%253A55.png</a>" title="The classic printing user interface&hellip; the one that works!" ></p>

<p>Clicking the big &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button in this screen and following the steps worked great for me. Another alternative is to use the CUPS web interface on <a href="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</a> but that can be a little more complicated.</p>

Back when I started uni, I bought a new <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2886" target="_blank">Asus A6J laptop</a>. It was one of the first laptops available with a dual core CPU (Core Duo, not Core 2 Duo) and decently powerful graphics (ATI X1600).<br />The A6J  is very dated now and weighing in at <span id="intelliTxt"> 2.85kg, its not very portable by today's standard (considering my <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html" target="_blank">Toshiba Portege</a> weighs just 1.13kg).</span> <br />A couple of years after I bought it, I got sick of carrying it around, so I bought an Asus EeePc as a replacement for uni, so the A6J stayed at home and was rarely used - it was just a spare for a long time.<br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Up until recently, I was using I used it as a (stationary) desktop replacement at work but I now have a new job where I am provided a  Macbook Pro so this old machine is now spare once again. This with the recent release of <a href="http://xbmc.org/natethomas/2012/03/24/xbmc-11-0-eden/" target="_blank">XBMC 11 Eden</a>, I thought I may as well re-purpose it as a permanent HTPC.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I considered quite a few options, such as running Arch Linux, OpenElec or Ubuntu with XBMC installed, or going with the recently improved XBMCbuntu (formerly known as XBMC Live).</span><br /><br /><h4>    <b><span id="intelliTxt">XBMCbuntu</span></b></h4><span id="intelliTxt">I downloaded the iso and had a bit of a play. I love how it boots directly into XBMC without the need to startup Unity or anything like that, although it does let you exit to the login screen and select either "XBMCbuntu" (LXDE) or "OpenBox" which is nice.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Once it had booted, it behaved so slow! I figured it mustn't have the correct drivers installed, so I tried to use the restricted drivers from the repo and after hitting quite a few problems I consulted the AMD site.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">The <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=2.4.1.3.12&amp;lang=English" target="_blank">AMD site explains</a> that my ATI X1600 is now "legacy" and is supported by the ATI Catalyst 9.3 proprietary linux driver.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">So I downloaded that and yet again hit a bunch of other issues.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I spent a fair portion of the day battling with this and couldn't help but think back to how easy Ubuntu Desktop handled all this, so I thought I'd just give that another go.</span><br /><br /><h4>     <b><span id="intelliTxt">Ubuntu Desktop + XBMC</span></b></h4><span id="intelliTxt">I downloaded the Ubuntu 11.10 iso and installed that over the top of XBMCbuntu and </span><span id="intelliTxt">configured the user account as 'xbmc' and to automatically login at startup.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I then followed the <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Installing_XBMC_for_Linux" target="_blank">instructions to install XBMC from their PPA</a>. I did a quick update, installed SSH, reconfigured grub to auto-boot in 1 second (instead of 10) and rebooted the machine.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">When I launched XBMC, it was perfect!</span><span id="intelliTxt"> It was very snappy and there was no lag whatsoever.</span><span id="intelliTxt">&nbsp;</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I noticed that the power menu was missing the shutdown options that were in XBMCbuntu and that the suspend option did not work.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">After a bit if research, I found a <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Suspend_and_wake_in_Ubuntu" target="_blank">wiki page</a> that explains how to modify <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">policykit</span> to allow xbmc access to all the power functions.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">With this change, shutdown, suspend and hibernate were all working great.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I had already configured Wake-On-Lan in the past, so all that I needed to do was setup the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.android.remote&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy54Ym1jLmFuZHJvaWQucmVtb3RlIl0." target="_blank">Android XBMC remote app</a> on my phone. After configuring the app with the laptops IP address, MAC address, etc. I was now able to use the "Turn your XBMC's Power On" button from the mobile app to fire up the laptop.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Of course to actually allow control of XBMC I needed to go into the settings screen and enable control via HTTP, etc. </span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">So now I can power up the laptop and shut it down from my phone, but when it boots, I am brought into a Unity environment. In the past I would add XBMC to the startup applications, but with XBMC Eden, there is a better way.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">XBMC Eden adds it self to the choice of desktop environments from the login screen (in other words, you get a choice: Unity or straight into XBMC like the live cd).</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">Unfortunately it doesn't remember the last choice with XBMC, so if I boot straight into it and then shut it down, next time it will still automatically boot in to Unity.</span><br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I then came across an <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoLogin#For_Ubuntu_10.04_.28Lucid_Lynx.29" target="_blank">Ubuntu community page</a> that pointed in the direction the the LightDM config file. (LightDM is the thing that manages the login screen).</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I opened '</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</span>' and saw this line:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">user-session=ubuntu</blockquote><br />I replaced the '<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ubuntu</span>' part of this line with '<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">XBMC</span>', rebooted and low and behold, it booted straight into XBMC!<br /><br /><span id="intelliTxt">I now have a fully functional HTPC that I can completely control from my phone.</span><br /><span id="intelliTxt">The only things left to do now are configure my media sources, install some plugins and maybe play with some new skins.</span>

<br />I finally decided to install Minecraft on my new shiny <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html" target="_blank">Toshiba Portege z830</a>.<br />Ubuntu ships with an open-source version of Java, which did run Minecraft, but the graphics were terrible, even on the lowest settings. There were artefacts everywhere!<br /><br />So as recommended, I switched to the official JRE, but now the login screen works, but that's about it. After logging in, I just got a black screen and the following exception in the console:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><div class="de2">Exception in thread "Minecraft main thread" java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError at net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.a(SourceFile:180) at net.minecraft.client.Minecraft.run(SourceFile:648) at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)</div><div class="de2">Caused by: java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0 at org.lwjgl.opengl.XRandR$Screen.&lt;init&gt;(XRandR.java:234) at org.lwjgl.opengl.XRandR$Screen.&lt;init&gt;(XRandR.java:196) at org.lwjgl.opengl.XRandR.populate(XRandR.java:87) at org.lwjgl.opengl.XRandR.access$100(XRandR.java:52)at org.lwjgl.opengl.XRandR$1.run(XRandR.java:110) at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) at org.lwjgl.opengl.XRandR.getConfiguration(XRandR.java:108) at org.lwjgl.opengl.LinuxDisplay.init(LinuxDisplay.java:618) at org.lwjgl.opengl.Display.&lt;clinit&gt;(Display.java:135)</div><div class="de1">... 3 more</div></blockquote><br />After discussing the problem in IRC, the solution was quite simple. It turns out "<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">lwjgl</span>" is a "<i>Light Weight Java Game Library</i>" and the version I had wasn't behaving.<br />On the advice of the helpful IRC'ers, I downloaded the latest "<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">lwjgl</span>" from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/" target="_blank">here</a> (which at time of writing is 2.8.3) to get it all to work nicely.<br /><br />To install it, I downloaded the zip file, extracted it to a temporary directory, then copied across these files:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">cp lwjgl-2.8.3/jar/lwjgl.jar ~/.minecraft/bin<br />cp lwjgl-2.8.3/native/linux/* ~/.minecraft/bin/natives</blockquote>Done! Now it works nicely.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Back in my first year of uni, I bought one of the early Core Duo (not Core 2 Duo) 15" Asus laptops which at the time was great and it had a decent graphics card for games, etc.<br />Roughly 6 years later, its showing its age. The battery lasts less than an hour now, it weighs about 3kg not including the adapter and performance is lacking compared to todays technology.<br /><br />After a recent shoulder injury and a busy week that involved me carrying my laptop from place to place, I decided it was time to reward myself with an early Christmas present and buy a new machine.<br /><br />My requirements were:<br /><ul><li>13" screen</li><li>As thin and as light as possible to aid portability</li><li>Powerful enough to do almost anything my daily activities could involve</li><li>&lt;~ $2000 </li></ul>I compared as many of these 13" <i>"ultrabooks"</i> as I could and before long I had created a shortlist of my top 3 - which included an Asus u-Series, a Macbook Air and a Samsung Series 9.<br /><br /><br /><b>Asus u-Series</b><br /><br />The <a href="http://www.asus.com.au/Notebooks/Superior_Mobility/U36SD/#specifications" target="_blank">Asus machines</a>, as usual, had a very good bang-for-buck, a nice thickness of 19mm and unlike most others, some models had full size video output and ethernet plugs.<br />While the price and size were right, the highest spec'ed machines were not quite as impressive as its competition. If budget was the number one concern, the Asus u-Series and Zenbook range offer pretty good value.<br /><br /><br /><b>Macbook Air</b><br /><br />I have never been a <i>"Mac person"</i> due to the traditional heavy pricing and proprietary nature of alot of their products, but these days (after some convincing) I believe the hardware and even price does have a surprisingly strong position in the competition.<br />The <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_pro" target="_blank">13" Macbook Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/macbookair/specs.html" target="_blank">Macbook Air</a> both had very good specs to offer for around the $2000 price tag, both with Core i7's, 4-8GB RAM and SSD's, not to mention pretty attractive packaging.<br />After seeing a Macbook Air up close, I really liked how the thickest point is about 17mm or so at the back but it tapers off to next to nothing at the front.<br /><br />So the model I chose for comparison purposes was worth $1928.99 and had the following specs:<br /><ul><li>1.8GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7</li><li>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM</li><li>256GB flash storage</li><li>Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter ($30)</li></ul>I don't like the very proprietary DisplayPort and its $30 adapters, but its not too bad as almost <i>everyone </i>at my office uses a Mac so finding a spare adapter when needed wouldn't be too hard (I guess popularity offsets proprietary-ness).<br /><br />The operating system did not bother me too much either as I intended to be running Linux as my primary OS anyway, but having a Mac would give me more familiarity with OSX which would be helpful considering its popularity in my line of work.<br /><br />The minor annoyances would be: expensive adapters for video and ethernet ports, unfamiliar keyboard layout (command key where alt should be, etc), non-upgradeable ram, glossy screen, etc. - but those are pretty minor.<br /><br /><br /><b>Samsung Series 9</b><br /><br />I found these ultrabooks to have a very unique look and one of the first well thought out, thin designs that are not just another Mac look-a-like.<br />The sales pitch always includes a spiel about its "Duralumin"- which is a light and strong material used in aircrafts and while it looks stunning and adds sophistication and uniqueness to the overall design on the unit, this material along with the black plastic are both fingerprint magnets!<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/pc-peripherals/notebook-pc/thin-light/NP900X3A-A03AU/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail&amp;tab=specification" target="_blank">specs of the Series 9 unit</a> I used for comparison (and ultimately bought) was quite good:<br /><ul><li>1.5GHz Core i7</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>256GB SSD</li><li>Micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter ($15) </li></ul>Initially I thought 1.5 GHz was kinda low, but after conversations with quite a few people and some <a href="http://ark.intel.com/compare/54616" target="_blank">research</a>, this speed is its sort-of <i>"resting"</i> frequency and will automatically scale up to 2.6GHz when required.<br /><br />The one big catch with this system is the RRP of ~$2700, while most Aussie shops sold them for ~$2500. This made me consider the Mac even more!<br /><br />But during my research I saw <a href="https://www.mln.com.au/" target="_blank">MLN</a>'s price drop down to a much more attractive $1997 and immediately rang them to find out more details and how long the special would last. It turns out that Samsung are starting to phase them out of stores (presumably to make way for a new product next year) and naturally they had sold alot of units and only had a few left.<br /><br />I did a bit more research and found that to save space, the ports are hidden behind very aircraft-like flaps, but as with the Mac, they are reduced size ports.<br />The video output is provided in the form of a micro-HDMI port - which is at least a more common format and I don't need to go through apple.com.<br />The other space-saving trade-off was a (sadly) proprietary ethernet port that comes bundled with an adapter to convert it to RJ45 - but unlike the Mac where you need to buy a USB network adapter, this actually has the network card built in, it just has an unusual plug - which I don't intend to use much anyway.<br /><br />Another plus is this model comes with 1x USB 3.0 port (and a 2.0 port) which is great considering the speeds my brother gets with his USB 3.0 flash drive.<br /><br />So I went to MLN and inspected the unit up close and what eventually made my decision for the Samsung was that for about the same price I get a machine with double the RAM (handy for VMs), a windows licence for portable gaming and a bunch of freebies from MLN including the HDMI to micro-HDMI cable, a set of Sennheiser headphones and a padded sleeve to carry it.<br /><br />I was able to get the cable and sleeve free because I opted to purchase the extended 3 year pickup warranty for an additional $180ish and the headphones were a Christmas present :)<br /><br />Initial impressions are very positive, the screen is incredibly bright and vibrant and with a smooth matte finish, I have had no issues using it outdoors.<br />The backlit keyboard is quite nice too, although the brightness of this light is controlled via windows drivers, so in linux (at this stage) I cant control its brightness.<br />The touchpad is large and seems to employ the same technique as the Mac Magic Mouse where there is one click-able button (the lower part of the pad) and depending on where your finger is when you click determines a right or left mouse click and once again, this doesnt work in Linux out of the box, but the standard 2 finger tap works as per normal.<br />Using Ubuntu 11.10 the rest of the hardware works out of the box, so no need to fiddle with drivers for network, graphics, webcam, etc.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with my purchase and its a huge step up from my old 15.4" 3kg laptop!
