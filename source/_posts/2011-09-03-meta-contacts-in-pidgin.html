<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<a href="http://pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a> is my IM client of choice, its one of the first things I replace in a stock installation of Ubuntu.<br />I chose Pidgin not because of a slick UI but because it has some really nice features!<br /><br />The two features that stand out the most in my opinion are the "buddy pounces" and the many available plugins:<br /><br /><b>Buddy pounces</b><b>:</b><br />For those that don't know about pounces, they are little predefined actions that can be triggered upon some configurable event, such as <i>"when &lt;SomeContact&gt; returns from away status, open a conversation window"</i>, or <i>"when &lt;SomeContact&gt; signs on, send them a predefined message"</i>.<br /><br /><b>Plugins:</b><br />Not only does Pidgin come with lots of plugins by default, but there are a lot of <a href="http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins">third party plugins</a> available too.<br />There are basic ones that offer a more robust and configurable way of notifying you of messages, etc and some more fun ones like "psychic mode" - which listens for when a new contact starts typing a message to you and pops up a convo window before they have even sent it.<br /><br /><b>Meta-contacts:</b><br />The one thing that I missed from other IM clients was meta-contacts.<br />For example, at any one time I have Pidgin signed into my Google chat, MSN and Facebook chat accounts and for those friends of mine that have an account on all three platforms, they appear 3 times in my buddy list.<br />With meta-contacts you can collapse those 3 contacts into just one.<br /><br />Well, it turns out this feature has been in Pidgin for quite a while, I just never noticed as its just not quite as obvious as with other clients.<br /><br /><b>How to use meta-contacts in Pidgin:</b><br />To use this feature, all you have to do is right-mouse click on the contact and click "expand" and drag and drop other contacts under the newly expanded name.<br />You should put the most common account at the top as that is the account is used by default when you double click the contact.<br /><br />Even though these features aren't exactly ground breaking, when you get used to having them there it becomes a little harder to go back to clients without them.
