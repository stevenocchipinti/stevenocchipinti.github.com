For quite a while now I've had my camera set to store a .JPG file and a raw .NEF file for every shot, but my theory was always that memory is so cheap that I may as well store everything and I'll only use the raw files if the JPG's turned out really bad. That has saved me a few times, but I never really learned how to process raw files properly.<br /><br />Recently we had a Christmas lunch at our place, and I was quite happy with some of the photos I took.<br />There was one set of photos I took of my little cousin Arabella and her expressions were just beautiful, except I really stuffed up my white balance and picture control!<br />I was shooting inside, then went outside and&nbsp;spontaneously took these photos without reconfiguring.<br /><br />My Nikon D90 has a raw file processor built in, so I could do post processing from the camera itself, but most professionals use Adobe Lightroom or something like that so they can use a nice big screen and have a lot more options for tweaking the photos.<br />Being a linux nerd, I decided to do a little research into open source alternatives and soon realised what my favourite is...<br /><br /><br /><b>RawTherapee</b><br /><br /><a href="http://rawtherapee.com/">RawTherapee</a> is really easy to use and they have builds for Linux, Mac and Windows.<br />It provides an interface to process the raw files, then export them either straight to a file or into an editor like The Gimp for further alterations.<br />I found the video below to be a good run down of the basic features, but there is even more than this.<br />The RawTherapee website&nbsp;provides quite a <a href="http://rawtherapee.com/blog/documentation">detailed manual</a> on every feature in the app.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1c3c33JVKVE" width="420"></iframe></div><br /><br /><b>My attempt</b><br /><br />I am still fairly new to raw processing, so a professional could probably do a better job than me, but I was fairly happy with the result so far - although with that said, my screen is not calibrated so it might only look good for me :P<br /><br />To dive straight in, the main things I adjusted in RawTherapee were the <i>'exposure compensation'</i>, <i>'black level'</i>, <i>'contrast'</i>, <i>'saturation'</i>, <i>'sharpening'</i>, <i>'curves'</i>,&nbsp;<i>'white balance'</i> and <i>'vibrance'</i>.<br />I'm used to adjusting these things in The Gimp, but the two most powerful tools here for me were the ability to easily change the <i>'exposure compensation'</i> and <i>'white balance'</i> - I normally find these things either pretty hard or sometimes impossible to get right from a processed JPG.<br /><br />Here are my results, the first photo is straight from the camera, the next is after processing in RawTherapee and the last is after some minor tweaks in The Gimp.<br /><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--giSUfcFUtE/UNg3_Tf6REI/AAAAAAAAAS8/6ETjJcVTG4Y/s1600/DSC_5597.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--giSUfcFUtE/UNg3_Tf6REI/AAAAAAAAAS8/6ETjJcVTG4Y/s320/DSC_5597.JPG" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Straight from the camera, with incorrect settings</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZdA-k_HOPzM/UNg4U1JsKhI/AAAAAAAAATE/8qr7EgoTYI0/s1600/DSC_5597e.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZdA-k_HOPzM/UNg4U1JsKhI/AAAAAAAAATE/8qr7EgoTYI0/s320/DSC_5597e.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">After processing in RawTherapee</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b2Mg3JIDJn4/UNg4zgpbdXI/AAAAAAAAATM/8bBACiQ_cYU/s1600/DSC_5597e2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-b2Mg3JIDJn4/UNg4zgpbdXI/AAAAAAAAATM/8bBACiQ_cYU/s320/DSC_5597e2.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">After adding some minor tweaks in The Gimp</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>Next steps</b><br /><br /><br />So I can do the basics now, but its far from perfect. The next steps for me are to practise more! I should process more files myself. The goal is to get into a easy workflow where I shoot, transfer to my machine, rate and process the raw's, edit the resulting JPG's if they need it, backup the whole lot and then share them with the world!<br /><br />I still have a lot to learn, but I'm looking forward to getting better at this!
