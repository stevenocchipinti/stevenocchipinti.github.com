Back on the 30th of May, I put up a blog post on how to do a <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/05/search-and-replace-in-multiple-files.html">search and replace in multiple files with Vim</a>.<br />I think this is a great way of doing substitutions in multiple files because you get to see a preview of what it looks like before you actually writing it to disk.<br /><br />This is great for a small number of files, but to do a large directory of files, you don't really gain any advantages as you're probably not going to open every file in a vim buffer and review each one separately.<br /><br />This is where <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">sed</span> and <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">find</span> come in handy!<br /><br />This command will replace every occurrence of the word "foo" with the word "bar" in all html files recursively from the current directory:<br /><blockquote><pre>find . -name "*.html" -exec sed -i "s/foo/bar/g" '{}' \;</pre></blockquote><br /><b>The explanation:</b><br /><br />This might look a little confusing, but it essentially 2 parts:<br /><br />The first part will list all the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">.html</span> files recursively and for each one, execute the command specified by the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">-exec</span> option:<br /><blockquote><pre>find . -name "*.html" -exec ...</pre></blockquote><br />The second part is the command to execute for each found file, which in this case is <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">sed</span>:<br /><blockquote><pre>sed -i "s/foo/bar/g" &lt;TheFile&gt;</pre></blockquote><br />The <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">'{}'</span> represents the current file and the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">\;</span> represents the end of the command to execute as part of the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">-exec</span> option.<br /><br /><br /><b>Doing more:</b><br /><br />As you can see, the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">-name</span> option to the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">find</span> command takes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29">glob pattern</a>.<br />If you wanted to be more specific about which files should have the substituion, you could use a regular expression instead, like this:<br /><blockquote><pre>find . -regex ".*[.]html\|.*[.]js" -exec sed -i "s/foo/bar/g" '{}' \;</pre></blockquote><br />This regex will match all files that end with ".html" or ".js".<br /><br />If you wanted to preview your changes before they are actually written to disk, there are a few ways of accomplishing this, but the simpliest is probably to modify the command as follows:<br /><blockquote><pre>find . -name "*.html" -exec sed "s/foo/bar/g" '{}' \; | less</pre></blockquote><br />Removing the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">"-i"</span> will mean that instead of writing the changes "in place", the changed output will be written to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">STDOUT</span> instead of the files.<br />Then to capture this (potentially large) output, we pipe it to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">less</span>.<br />From within <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">less</span> you will be able to do searches (with the "<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/</span>" key) and scroll through the output to do a quick sanity check.<br />Once your happy, you can remove the pipe and add the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">"-i"</span> option again to make it permanent!
