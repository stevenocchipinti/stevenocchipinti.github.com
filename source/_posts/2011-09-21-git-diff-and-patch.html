I recently found myself in a situation where I need to comment out  certain lines in my code in order to test a particular set of features.<br /><br />These  commented out lines are only for my local development environment but will be useful in the future if this set of features needs work again.<br />In this situation, checking them into Git or making a personal <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">.gitignore</span> file are not suitable solutions.<br /><br />I have found 2 good ways of accomplishing this:<br /><br /><br /><b>Git stash:</b><br /><br />Starting from a clean checkout, I put my temporary changes in place, then run this command:<br /><blockquote>git stash save temp workaround for some issue </blockquote><br />Then I continue on with my work. I selectively leave these changes out of all my commits using <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git add -i</span> then once everything is checked in except my temporary changes, I revert these temporary changes with <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git checkout -- .</span> so I'm left with a clean repository.<br /><br />When I need to work on a related feature again, I can list my stashes with:<br /><blockquote>git stash list</blockquote><br />Then, apply the most recent stash by running this command:<br /><blockquote>git stash apply</blockquote><br />If you have more than one stash, you can specify which stash you want to apply on the command line. See <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git stash --help</span> to see more information.<br /><br /><br /><b>Git diff and patch:</b> <br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">diff</span> and <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">patch</span> are very useful tools to be familiar with if you ever deal with text. Git's <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">diff</span> output is much the same, and so the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">patch</span> tool is still very handy!<br /><br />Starting from a clean checkout, I put my temporary changes in place, then run this command:<br /><blockquote>git diff &gt; ~/patches/temp_workaround.patch</blockquote><br />Then I continue on with my work. I selectively leave these changes out  of all my commits using <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git add -i</span> then once everything is checked in  except my temporary changes, I revert these temporary changes with <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git  checkout -- .</span> so I'm left with a clean repository.<br /><br />When I need to work on a related feature again, I can apply my patch by running this command from the project root:<br /><blockquote>patch -p1 &lt; ~/patches/temp_workaround.patch</blockquote><br /><br />Both of these methods will put my temporary work arounds in place again which saves me trying to work out which lines I needed to comment out everytime. Saving the stashes and/or patch files with descriptive names means you can find and re-use these temporary changes quite easily in the future.
