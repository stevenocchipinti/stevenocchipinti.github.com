Warning, this is a rant! <br />Mac is ok, but not great.<br /><br />- Command+Q is annoying, things stay open otherwise! (ctrl+d in terminal, :q in vim)<br />- Xcode, Mac developer account, etc. was painful!<br />- Home and End buttons don't always work! Use command+arrows, but sometimes that has another function like in Adium to switchtabs, or back and forward in a browser. <br />- iTerm2 is featureful, reminds me on Konsole (splits), integrates with Tmux! <br />- The terminal is comfortable, but some commands are different (BSD vs GNU) <br />- Spaces &amp; Mission control is pretty good <br />- Wheel click defaults to the dashboard, can't open links in tabs in firefox, fixed in settings<br />- F keys default to secondary behaviour, I changed them back in the settings (F3 in Firefox)<br />- Cant just click on the terminal in the dock to open a new (additional) one <br />- I can never remember how to screenshot! F1[3-5] seem to have replaced those keys :/<br /><br />apt-get == brew (but slower because it compiles from source) <br />libnotify == Growl (costs money in Lion)<br />Compiz grid, etc. == Cinch, Divy, etc. (none of these are free!)<br />A system monitor widget in the dock even costs money! <br />pidgin == Adium (both based on libpurple)<br />gvim == mvim (no build ctags button)<br /><br />I've gained the ability to run MS Office for Mac seamlessly and OSX familiarity.<br />Dual screen support is really great!<br />Power and USB ports in the screen is nice.<br />Magnetic power plug :/ yipee
