If you saw my <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/11/13-core-i7-samsung-series-9-ultrabook.html">last post</a>, you would have seen that I recently bought a 13" Samsung Series 9 ultrabook - I still think these machines are stunning!<br /><br /><br /><b>The problem</b><br /><br />There are a couple of little complaints floating around about the Samsung, like heat output, easily finger-printed chasis, but none of these <i>really</i> bother me, but there is one thing that does... alot... and its the wifi!<br /><br />I could be using the laptop in the next room from my wireless router and it would dropout completely or go incredibly slow, if I move to the other side of the house where my bedroom is, my phone will have full reception, but this laptop will not see the wifi network at all - and this in unacceptable.<br /><br /><br /><b>The transition</b><br /><br />After returning the laptop (twice) I eventually asked for my money back so I could go purchase my second preference - the Macbook Air.<br />Unfortunately, the shop would not give me a full refund and could only offer me a credit note.<br />I tried to explain that no other units in store could offer me the same specs that I was after, the Samsung's best competition is the Macbook Air, but as they couldn't help me I asked to see what else they have in a light 13".<br /><br />The sales guy showed me an <a href="http://zenbook.asus.com/" target="_blank">Asus Zenbook</a> and a new product which had just arrived to their store, the <a href="http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/portege/z830/" target="_blank">Toshiba Portege Z830</a>.<br />I was lucky enough to be the first to see this at their store and even got to open the display model and check it out.<br /><br />The decision between the two was tough!<br />The Asus Zenbook had a very sturdy exterior and had a similar tapered  design to the Macbook Air while the Toshiba Portege had a business feel  to it, but was slightly lighter and thinner. <br />They were both similarly spec'ed with Core i5's, 128GB SSD's and 4GB of RAM, but there were a few notable differences between them.<br /><br />Although the Asus Zenbook does not have a backlit keyboard and has reduced size ports, it does has a higher resolution screen than the Samsung and Toshiba, but like the Mac it's a glossy screen. I personally prefer matte screens because even in brightly lit areas or even outside in direct sunlight, the screen is alot more visible. <br /><br />The Toshiba Portege has a matte screen, backlit keyboard, has a full size HDMI port, VGA port, Ethernet port, 2x USB 2.0 ports, 1x USB 3.0 port and SD card reader and its thinner and lighter. Toshiba also give a 3 year warranty out-of-the-box with this model.<br />The screen is quite a bit more flimsy than the others and the system fan does tend to groan a little (compared to the Samsung at least), but this is probably all I can complain about.<br /><br /><br /><b>The solution</b><br /><br />I took a day to think about it and eventually made up my mind for the Portege.<br />In the US, there is an i7 variety with 6GB of RAM, but I don't really want to wait for it to get here.<br />I took a look at a <a href="http://ark.intel.com/compare/54616,56858" target="_blank">comparison</a> between the i7 from the Samsung and the i5 from the Toshiba, and while I would have paid the extra for the i7, I don't think I'll really notice the difference in most scenarios.<br /><br />It seems I am not the only one who ended up swapping a Samsung Series 9 for a Toshiba Portege Z830 either, I came across this <a href="http://thessdreview.com/our-reviews/sata-3/toshiba-z830-13-3-ultrabook-laptop-review-toshiba-creates-one-amazing-ultrabook/" target="_blank">blog post</a> where the author goes into more detail and provides results of quite specific tests.<br /><br />In the end I paid $1539 for the laptop with a 3 year warranty and then an extra $79 to upgrade it to 6GB of RAM.<br />While it's no Samsung Series 9, its pretty nice and the cut in performance saved me a little more than $600.

    Nice post Steve...<br /><br />If you dig a little deeper you will notice that I was the only reviewer to identify the severe Series 9 wifi problems initially, problems which are still prevalent today:<br /><br />http://thessdreview.com/our-reviews/the-samsung-series-9-13-900x3a-a01ca-review-this-may-be-a-work-of-art-almost/

    Thanks! I appreciate the feedback :)<br /><br />I did read that post too and while it did scare me, I immediately asked a friend (who also owns one) if he had experienced the same issues, which he didn&#39;t - so with mixed feedback and such a nice machine, I just had to try.<br /><br />After some issues, I ended up doing the same wifi speed comparisons as you with other laptops in the house and got mixed results - which unfortunately I could not prove to the store at the time I returned it.<br /><br />Needless to say, like yourself, I am very disappointed as I started to become attached to the very well built machine.<br /><br />It&#39;s a real shame, but the Toshiba is going strong so far :)

    Nice call Steven and thats coming from the site owner at &#39;that blogpost&#39; eheheh.  I went through 4 x Series 9 laptops before getting the Z830, mine being an i7.  IMHO, the lid isn&#39;t flimsy, but rather, reflective of just how thin it is. It is the thinnest ultra on the market.<br /><br />I as well have read all the comments regarding fan issues but have yet to be bothered by mine whatsoever.  I expected such with a laptop that is this thin in any case.<br /><br />Again nice post!

    Haha, thanks Les :) Means a lot to me!<br /><br />Wow, you went through 4! I went through 2 and the shop were getting quite annoyed with me, lol.<br /><br />After using the screen for a while now, I do actually like the thickness of it, and the fan noise is only evident when there is no other background noise around (like late at night).<br /><br />My complaints with the Toshiba are very minor, but I am very happy with this machine.<br /><br />As I run 2 operating systems, one day I&#39;ll have to consider upgrading the SSD and I&#39;m sure your site will be of great help to me when that time comes!<br /><br />Thanks for the comments :)

    I know it&#39;s too late for you now (congrats on the Toshiba, looks like a nice machine!) but I recently saw this on the Samsung Q&amp;A website, and thought it might help other people Googling for this issue.  I haven&#39;t confirmed that it works, but another commenter on the Q&amp;A site did.<br /><br />From: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/allQuestion.do?prd_mdl_name=NP900X3A<br /><br /><br />A : I can&#39;t speak for the Broadcom WiFi card, but for the Intel card (and perhaps also for the Broadcom card), the issue is with the default power management settings. If the laptop works well when plugged in and using the &quot;Samsung Optimized&quot; power plan but works poorly when not plugged in, this is your issue. To fix it, go to Control Panel (View by: Small icons) *or* right click on the battery icon in the system tray area, then select Power Options. For the current plan, click Change plan settings, then click Change advanced power settings. Expand Wireless Adapter Settings, expand Power Saving Mode, then set Plugged in: to &quot;Maximum Performance&quot; (see screenshot). This is the only setting that works properly--I&#39;ve tried all of them. Make this change for all of the power plans, or at least all of the ones you intend to use.

    How do you feel about the performance with Ubuntu? I just bought a Portege Z830 fully-loaded and it seems to lock up at least a couple of times a day on heavy IO tasks. That may be just because I&#39;m running a Wubi install though (couldn&#39;t wait to get Ubuntu installed).

    Hi Mike,

I have had a great experience with Ubunt...

    Hi Mike,<br /><br />I have had a great experience with Ubuntu.<br />I&#39;m running Ubuntu 11.10 with Gnome Shell and have never really seen any lag or lockups.<br />I haven&#39;t made any optimizations or anything, its all just stock standard.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t tried Wubi on this machine, I have partitioned my 128GB SSD down the middle, which doesn&#39;t leave alot of space per OS.<br />I am even considering taking Windows off, considering I barely ever use it these days.
