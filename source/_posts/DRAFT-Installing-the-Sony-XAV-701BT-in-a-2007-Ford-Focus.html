Recently I bought a 2007 Ford Focus and I'm pretty happy with it! There are a few minor things I don't like, but all-in-all it's a great little car. The stereo however was a bit poor. It plays CD's but not MP3's and had next to nothing in features. Luckily it did have an&nbsp;auxiliary&nbsp;input, but the socket is in the glovebox! I found that to be a little inconvenient when I want to plug my phone it to the power socket (on the front panel) and the sound in the glove box, but it was better than not having it.<br /><br />I had a few JB hifi vouchers collected up, so I thought I should buy a new stereo and started the research. My car has, what looks like a double din slot, but it's actually bigger than that, so I knew I would have to buy an fascia adapter with whatever choice I made. I ended up deciding on the <a href="http://www.sony.com.au/product/xav-701bt">Sony XAV701BT</a>. This unit is pretty slick! It has a large 7" touch screen,&nbsp;Bluetooth handsfree, plays DVD's, XVID's, files off a USB drive, etc. and an interesting feature called MirrorLink.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mirrorlink.com/">Mirrorlink</a> is a new standard that is designed to make it easier and safer to use your phone while you're in your car. When I connect my phone to the unit's USB drive, it will mirror the phone's display on the screen and the touch screen feeds back to the phone. What's great about this is my phone already has all my music, my contacts, GPS and internet access. In car GPS units don't normally have internet access, so navigating to a restaurant by name, or getting traffic updates isn't really possible, but my phone can!<br /><br /><br /><b>The parts and tools</b><br /><br />To install it I needed to get some parts from ebay, including a fascia adapter (to convert the slot in my car to a standard double din), a wiring harness (that connects to my car's existing wiring, saves me cutting the original wiring), an aerial adapter and some removal tools to get the Ford stereo out.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20zrF8xsoMQ/UVVo_dOVJNI/AAAAAAAABKU/JKFvQefDVXE/s1600/20130119_172557.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-20zrF8xsoMQ/UVVo_dOVJNI/AAAAAAAABKU/JKFvQefDVXE/s320/20130119_172557.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Tools to remove the existing Ford stereo</td></tr></tbody></table>The first problem for this job was that the wiring harness I got from ebay did not suit my car! I checked at the local auto shops and they didn't either. It turns out that the plug in my Ford Focus is not used in all of them. After emailing some photos to the ebay seller, we worked out that the plug in my car is actually from a Ford Fiesta, but they were kind enough to send me out one of those free of charge. Very good service from <a href="http://myworld.ebay.com.au/caraudiosupermarket">this seller</a>!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XdF3eXpWNCw/UVVqfyZrTRI/AAAAAAAABKg/xZ5RD-QtsF0/s1600/20121113_200637+(1).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XdF3eXpWNCw/UVVqfyZrTRI/AAAAAAAABKg/xZ5RD-QtsF0/s320/20121113_200637+(1).jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The plug that my car's wiring uses</td></tr></tbody></table>While I was browsing around ebay, I also saw how cheap reverse cameras are and seeming so the Sony head unit supports this I also ended up buying one them too. They are basically just a little low-res webcam after all! The one I bought is pretty good, it cost about $15 and it is designed for my car and goes where a number plate light goes.<br /><br /><br /><b>Installing the head unit</b><br /><br />There were a few hurdles installing the unit, the first was trying to workout which wire from the Sony plug maps to which wire on the wiring harness from my car. I found that finding this sort of information is quite difficult, especially compared to research in IT. My source was a random <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN15v6_zGvs">YouTube video</a> and then we tested the wires ourselves to be sure. We eventually got the ebay wiring harness soldered to the Sony wiring. This made it so much easier than trying to join it straight into the cars wiring!<br /><br />The next step was to mount the unit to the car. Sony supply a set of brackets in the box. There are two brackets that screw into the unit it self, then they slide into a cage and click into place. You can then use the supplied removal tools to release it again. The cage should be mounted in the car but that's where the problems started. The cage did not really fit in the car! It was only a few mm too tall to fit in nicely and there wasn't anywhere to really fix it to the car strongly. So we had to find an alternative.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ROLQnKYfL8Y/UVVzbSWgLeI/AAAAAAAABK0/PKdhRIZkhik/s1600/20130119_173142.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ROLQnKYfL8Y/UVVzbSWgLeI/AAAAAAAABK0/PKdhRIZkhik/s320/20130119_173142.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The Sony bracket</td></tr></tbody></table>The next attempt was to use the brackets that the original stereo was using. These brackets were a bit different, they just screw on to the unit and click in to place in the car. I would then just use the same removal tools to get it out later. We attached these stock brackets to the Sony and it looked like it was all going to fit just fine. As we were about to slide it in, we noticed the Sony is a tad wider than the original and this meant that it would still slide in, but the removal tools would not have enough room to release properly. It would have been stuck there! After that close call, we had to find another alternative.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Pq3nzYj_x6U/UVVzyjB9FrI/AAAAAAAABLE/w0QDCrm5MnM/s1600/20130119_172538.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Pq3nzYj_x6U/UVVzyjB9FrI/AAAAAAAABLE/w0QDCrm5MnM/s320/20130119_172538.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The brackets from the original Ford stereo</td></tr></tbody></table>We ended up getting some L-shaped metal and making our own brackets. This was much easier because we can cut these to size and drill the holes exactly where we need them. It worked pretty well!<br />After it was mounted and we had the wiring all connected, we slipped on the fascia adapter over the top and turned it all on. Success! It was all working great!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ps1cqsGgn3k/UVV0YRWaskI/AAAAAAAABLM/5gPTgX2e5y0/s1600/20130119_195902.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ps1cqsGgn3k/UVV0YRWaskI/AAAAAAAABLM/5gPTgX2e5y0/s320/20130119_195902.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Our home made brackets</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Reverse parking camera</b><br /><br />The next step was to install the rear camera. I pulled out one of the number plate lights and took off the plastic covers from the inside of the boot. Because the camera is replacing the number plate light, it has an LED so the number plate is still illuminated. That part is easy to wire up because there is already power there from the original light. There is also a separate power plug and video lead for the camera.<br /><br />To get power for the camera, our first thought was it needs to be constant 12 volts. In the boot there wasn't much that has constant 12 volts! There is the rear wiper and brake lights, which are obviously not always on and the boot latch, which is actually always on. The boot latch has a small button, which powers a servo to open the boot, which meant we could get power from before the button.<br />To get video from the camera to the head unit, we ran a lead through the boot, into the car and along the ground past the left side doors into the back of the glove box and into the stereo.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dDwyyZnG-yE/UVV1l7nzaHI/AAAAAAAABLU/UpLlaW8xh6g/s1600/20130120_150350.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dDwyyZnG-yE/UVV1l7nzaHI/AAAAAAAABLU/UpLlaW8xh6g/s320/20130120_150350.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The plug for the boot latch servo</td></tr></tbody></table>It was time to try it! We turned it all on and got "no signal". We went over everything and it all seemed ok. Some possible causes could be that we were using the head unit wrong (wrong input, safety switch, etc.), a faulty camera, a bad video connection or a bad power connection. To test the video, I borrowed my brothers Raspberry Pi and plugged it in to the cable from the camera that was connected to the head unit. That worked, so we were using it correctly and the video cable was fine.<br /><br />The next thing to test was the power, so we metered the voltage coming from the power source in the boot and it read in at 11.3 volts. It's not quite the required 12 volts. Suspecting we didn't have enough power, we tried to find an alternative power source. There was nothing else in the boot that was of use, so the next best thing was the reverse lamp. We traced the cable under the car and in to the back seats, where we could splice it from. To test this theory we held cable in place from that point to the camera and turned it all on - it worked! We metered the voltage from that point and it read in at 11.8 volts. We were half a volt off! We ran that cable up to the boot along with an earth we took from the chasis. It is actually kind of hard to find a decent earth too. All the bare metal is painted and most things are clipped together instead of bolted, so we ended up drilling a small hole and putting a small bolt in for an earth.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K26954m__0E/UVV3YZrtCNI/AAAAAAAABL0/yM-qNe64FV0/s1600/20130120_150429.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-K26954m__0E/UVV3YZrtCNI/AAAAAAAABL0/yM-qNe64FV0/s320/20130120_150429.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Getting the wires through this was difficult - it's pretty full now!</td></tr></tbody></table>We ended up getting the camera all hooked up with our new power source, which meant it would only ever have power when the reverse lamp was on, but that's fine. If we connect this reverse lamp power to the head unit, it will even automatically switch to the camera feed when I put it in reverse. So we ran yet another wire from that same spot up to the front and connected it up to our wiring harness.<br /><br />We were at the stage where we had the stereo mounted and working with all the speakers and the reverse camera was working and automatically turned on by changing gear. I was very happy.<br /><br /><br /><b>The fascia adapter</b><br /><br />The fascia adapter fit nicely over the top, but didn't cover the entire gap. The Sony came with a small flimsy bit of plastic to put of the face to cover the hole, but it didn't quite fit in the fascia adapter from eBay, so we spent the rest of the night cutting and filling tiny amounts off that until it fit nicely. We glued it together and it looked great!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bLr1VBzjxTY/UVV2YhDBtRI/AAAAAAAABLg/TytrQPr8nwA/s1600/20130119_221406.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bLr1VBzjxTY/UVV2YhDBtRI/AAAAAAAABLg/TytrQPr8nwA/s320/20130119_221406.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The Sony plastic fascia inside the ebay fascia adapter</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BKdDYqH9H1Q/UVV2cJaGgnI/AAAAAAAABLo/jj_RIz_HBQ8/s1600/20130121_185333.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BKdDYqH9H1Q/UVV2cJaGgnI/AAAAAAAABLo/jj_RIz_HBQ8/s320/20130121_185333.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The end product!</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><b>Microphone for Bluetooth handsfree</b><br /><br />This stereo has Bluetooth handfree built in, but the microphone is external. I actually think this is a good idea, because it a previous stereo the microphone was built in to the front of the head unit and the sound quality was unusable while the car was moving due to road noise.<br /><br />Installing this was pretty trivial. The microphone came with a decent length of wire and a double sided tape pad. I decided to mount the microphone just in front of the dash, above the steering wheel column pointing directly at my face. To do this in the Focus, the plastic cover above the steering wheel column just pops out and there is an nice easy gap to get to the back of the the head unit. We ran the cable, plugged it in and stuck the microphone down and we were done! ...too easy!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4UboCpp7jQ/UVV7B6aGPnI/AAAAAAAABME/ylzeQgF1Xzs/s1600/20130127_172352.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B4UboCpp7jQ/UVV7B6aGPnI/AAAAAAAABME/ylzeQgF1Xzs/s320/20130127_172352.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The handsfree microphone</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Hand brake (safety lead)</b><br /><br />This stereo has a safety feature to prevent people from watching videos while they drive. To do this, the hand brake must be engaged before video will work. To get to the hand brake switch in my car is pretty difficult so it was very tempting to just short out that safety switch (I'm a safe person and wouldn't drive with video playing anyway!), but we persisted with it anyway - if we're going to do this, we may as well do it properly!<br /><br />After pulling off as many plastic panels as we could, we finally exposed the wire we needed at the base of the hand brake, but we needed to splice into it and connect the wire from the stereo and there was barely room to put a single finger down there and basically no slack on that wire. This is where my dad had a trick up his sleeve. We used this clip:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SlA0YqdC43c/UVV8KQkCsEI/AAAAAAAABMM/MYoZnLisP1U/s1600/20130127_173720.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SlA0YqdC43c/UVV8KQkCsEI/AAAAAAAABMM/MYoZnLisP1U/s320/20130127_173720.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Wire joining clamp</td></tr></tbody></table>These clips are great! You basically put two wires into it and when you push the metal clamp down, it pierces both wires, joining them together. We were able to run the handbrake lead from the stereo to the hand brake underneath the plastic panels, then placed it in this clamp, held on to it&nbsp;gently&nbsp;with long pointy nose pliers and lowered it down into the gap enough to clamp it. It worked like a charm!<br /><br /><br /><b>USB ports</b><br /><br />The stereo has two female USB cables hanging out the back. There are used for playing media, connecting a phone for Mirrorlink and I also wanted to use them to charge my phone. I just needed to find a good place to put them. After debating a few ideas, I decided I wanted them mounted on the center panel with the stereo, but closer to the bottom so a short USB cable could charge my phone while it sits in the small compartment just behind the gear stick.<br /><br />There are four small square panels here, one of which is a button for the rear&nbsp;demister, and the other three are just empty placeholders. After pulling them off and taking a look, the plastic was moulded in such a way where the gap from the back, right in the middle was almost perfect for these cables. It was actually a little bit too tight, which was great because with a bit of extra force, they stayed in place without needing anything to hold them there. So we cut some rectangular holes in the front of one of them and jammed the cable in from the back and it worked great! It also means that if I ever take this stereo out, we can just get the same plastic placeholders to replace the ones we drilled through - no damage to the larger plastic panels.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aPjieGdTltg/UVV_6LneWfI/AAAAAAAABMc/ZG1F9bQEaiU/s1600/20130127_132545.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aPjieGdTltg/UVV_6LneWfI/AAAAAAAABMc/ZG1F9bQEaiU/s320/20130127_132545.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The USB cable from the stereo</td></tr></tbody></table><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ukmmXp0A4QE/UVV_6miM9xI/AAAAAAAABMg/qC8NRIknX1o/s1600/20130127_172330.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ukmmXp0A4QE/UVV_6miM9xI/AAAAAAAABMg/qC8NRIknX1o/s320/20130127_172330.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">After drilling the hole in the placeholder and jamming the cable in place</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><b>Steering wheel remote control</b><br /><br />This is the last step!
