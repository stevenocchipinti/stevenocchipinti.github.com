<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
By default, the indicator applet in the Unity panel has an item in the list for evolution and another for empathy - two programs I don't use!<br /><br />But, its quite easy to get rid of them! All you have to do is remove the appropriate file in /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications<br /><br />Instead of removing them, I just removed all read permissions (root can still do anything with it of course)<br /><blockquote>$ cd /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications<br />$ sudo chmod 000 empathy evolution</blockquote>
