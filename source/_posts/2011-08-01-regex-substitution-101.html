A while ago I was helping a friend with a regex.<br />He  wanted to extract parts of the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/etc/passwd</span> file, so I explained my basic thought process to him so he could understand how I came up with the pattern.<br />I thought I would (paraphrase and) blog this explanation, as it might just help others out too.<br /><br /><b>The Explanation:</b><br />First you have to write a regex that matches as much of the string (in this case the lines in the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">passwd</span> file) as you need (or all of it to be safe):<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">[^:]</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = will match a character that is not a colon</blockquote><br />You can repeat this pattern with the * operator to match everything up to the first colon (because that wont match the pattern):<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">[^:]*</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = will match everything up to the colon</blockquote><br />That pattern obviously doesnt have the bit you want, so you need to keep matching...<br />The next character you need to match is the colon itself:<br /><br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">[^:]*:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = will match everything up to the colon, and then one colon character too</blockquote><br />This isn't enough either, but now you just need to repeat your self for as many sections as you want.<br />There is 6 colons and 7 fields in your example of the passwd file, so repeat the pattern to suit:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*</div></blockquote><br />Now this pattern will match the entire string by going through section-by-section.<br />Of course .* would also match the whole string, but now we have parts of the pattern that represent parts of the string.<br />Using these parts, we can wrap the bit you want to use with backreferences (brackets) so we can use them later.<br /><br />Lets say you only wanted the 5th field (the username).<br />First, wrap the 5th field in a backreference.<br />Note you have to escape the brackets with a backslash otherwise it will look for an actual bracket character:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:\([^:]*\):[^:]*:[^:]*</div></blockquote><br />Now you can use it in a substitution, which will replace everything that is matched with what you tell it to:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:%s/[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:\([^:]*\):[^:]*:[^:]*/hello</div></blockquote><br />This will replace what it has matched (which is everything) with the word 'hello'<br />Now you can add that part that you captured earlier with the backreference<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:%s/[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:\([^:]*\):[^:]*:[^:]*/hello \1</div></blockquote><br />The \1 means the first backreference, if you had 2 sets of backets, you could also use \2<br />Running this substition will result in this line:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">apache:x:48:48:Apache:/var/www:/sbin/nologin</div></blockquote><br />becoming this line:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">hello Apache</div></blockquote><br />To extend this further, you could add stuff like this:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:%s/[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:\([^:]*\):\([^:]*\):[^:]*/hello \1, I know you home is \2 because I know regex</div></blockquote><br />Which would result in this line:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">hello Apache, I know you home is /var/www because I know regex</div></blockquote><br />Obviously you wouldnt want to make these substitutions in your passwd file, but you could use this regex substitution in a pipeline with sed, like this:<br /><br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">cat /etc/passwd | sed "s/[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:\([^:]*\):\([^:]*\):[^:]*/hello \1, I know you home is \2 because I know regex/" &gt; ~/regexed.txt</div></blockquote><br />Note that unlike vim, sed requires the substitution to be terminated with a trailing separator, so valid syntaxes are:<br /><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></div><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">sed =&nbsp; sed 's/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/'</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">vim =&nbsp; :s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT/</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">vim =&nbsp; :s/PATTERN/REPLACEMENT</div></blockquote><br />The last separator is useful for putting additional options, such as <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">g</span> for global replaces (multiple times on one line), etc.<br /><br />Another helpful note is that the separator does not have to be / it could be (almost) any character.<br />For example, / might be cumbersome if your dealing with paths that have a lot of /'s, so you could use # instead:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">%s#this#that#g </span></blockquote>

    FWIW, vim doesn&#39;t require that you don&#39;t include the trailing seperator, and inherently requires it to use modifiers, so including it is a good habit to develop regardless.
