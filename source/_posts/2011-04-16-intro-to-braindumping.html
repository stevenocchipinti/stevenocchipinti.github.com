<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
Not the most creative name for your average blog, but for those that dont know:<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><blockquote><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>"the transfer of a large quantity of information from one person to  another or to a piece of paper can be referred to as a 'brain dump'."</i></span><br /><div style="text-align: right;"><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_dump">Wikipedia</a></i></span></div></div></blockquote></div><br />I created this blog mainly as a place to keep a record of things I'm likely to forget, such as cool command line tricks, handy websites, etc.<br />Nothing very important, just random thoughts really.
