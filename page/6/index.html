I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn how to script The Gimp for a while now, but have never bothered to put the time aside to do it. Well, I finally did it, and this is why and how :)<br /><br /><b>The story:</b><br /><b>&nbsp;</b> <br />When I had my 21st birthday, my brother made the party invites for me. He added a whole bunch of photos and I&#8217;ve still got a copy of that with all my photos as a keepsake.<br />Now his birthday is coming up and I thought I would repay the favour.<br /><br />The Idea I had was to scan a bunch of old photos (like he did), then use The Gimp to make them look like printed photos (white border, drop shadow, kind of like polaroids) and scatter them around a &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; title.<br /><br />I spent quite a while scanning the photos, adding them all as layers to a single canvas, resizing them to suit and then individually adding white padding, a black stroke around the outside, dropping a shadow, rotating and moving each individual layer to lay it out nicely, I was finally happy with the end result and saved a .xcf and then exported a .jpg.<br />At this stage I had all the scans, a font, a background image, the .xcf and the .jpg all saved in a folder on my desktop. <br />I quit The Gimp, got a flash drive and copied the .jpg over so I got get it printed, shutdown the pc and went for dinner.<br /><br />When I got back quite some time later, my pc hadn&#8217;t quite shutdown yet, it just had a black screen.. So I left it a little longer and it still hadn&#8217;t shutdown, so I held down the power button to force it.<br />The next day, I got asked to make a small adjustment to the invite, and to my horror, I could not find the .xcf anywhere! I had the exported .jpg from the flash drive, but that wasn&#8217;t suitable to make the adjustment&#8230; something had happened and to this day I&#8217;m still not sure what, but I lost all my work&#8230; When I realised I had to redo all that work, that&#8217;s when I put time aside to learn how to script The Gimp!<br /><br /><b>Scripting The Gimp:</b><br /><br />I took a look at some code examples for The Gimp&#8217;s script-fu functionality and having never learned Lisp, it looked pretty foreign to me! That&#8217;s when I noticed there was a Python-fu equivalent (luckily).<br /><br />Using the Python Console from within Gimp is really easy!<br />It has a &#8220;Browse&#8221; button which brings up the &#8220;Python Procedure Browser&#8221; - which is a list of functions that interact with The Gimp.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nKAIY9543z0/ThBPoNzjquI/AAAAAAAAAB8/TqfEJU2SvEI/s1600/gimp-console.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nKAIY9543z0/ThBPoNzjquI/AAAAAAAAAB8/TqfEJU2SvEI/s320/gimp-console.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />Using the filterbox at the top, you can easily find the python function that matches the action you would normally execute using The Gimp&#8217;s menus (such as a layer resize, or filter).<br />When you select the function, it will show you a basic man page on what it does and the parameters it takes, and applying this function will insert the code into the console with place holders for the parameters, which you can then simply modify and execute.<br /><br />After getting the basics from Googling around, I made a basic script that I just copied and pasted into the console when I wanted to execute the repetitive actions.<br />I then optimised the script by wrapping it in a function, doing all my actions in a separate context (as not to disturb the users context for things like selected brush, etc.) and also group all my actions in a single undo (to simplify the history and make it easy to undo what my script does).<br /><br /><b>Work-arounds:</b><br /><br />There are a couple of hacks in the script that I couldn&#8217;t work out the nice way around in a short period of time (I&#8217;m still a n00b).<br />Rather than working out how to fix it, I thought I would just describe them here. <br /><br />One of those being that to add a white border around a layer, I need to resize the layer with an offset, and this new extra space would not always be white (regardless of my selected background color). My work around was to add a white layer behind it and merge it down.<br /><br />The other hack was with stoking. To add a 1px black stroke around a layer, I normally just specify 1px black from the stroke dialogue (as opposed to using the selected brush). I could not find an equivalent to this in the Python API - it always used the selected brush. <br />As the default brushes include a 1px brush (and a 3px brush, but no 2px brush) I thought I&#8217;d use that, but to do a stroke around the outside of a layer, I needed to select-all, then stoke, but with a 1px brush, I could not specify I wanted that 1px to be on the inside of the selection. So stroking with this method put the line on the top and left sides, not on the bottom and right.<br />The hack I used here is to rotate 180 degrees, stroke and repeat.<br /><br />Not the most elegant of scripts, but this was my first attempt and got the job done.<br /><br /><b>Registering the script with The Gimp:</b><br /><br />So now that the script was working (albeit with work arounds) and I added the polish (function definition, separate context, grouped undo, etc.) I was ready to add it to the menus just like any other filter.<br />I used an existing script (located in ~/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins/) as a baseline and adjusted it for my new script (that I called &#8220;photofy&#8221;).<br />This part of the code allows you to specify the name of the script, where in the menu it should be registered and if there are any user-specified inputs to the script you can even specify a simple GUI for a dialogue box to get them from the user - which I did to collect the desired size of the white margin.<br />You can see this part of the code at the bottom of the python script.<br /><br /><b>Demo:</b><br /><br />So now the fun part, this is how you use it :)<br />Here is a simple image with 2 layers: a white background layer and a smaller subject layer (the gradient).<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lpQOJzvaj44/Tgb-hNSxBwI/AAAAAAAAABs/baRi7vX9YCE/s1600/1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="284" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lpQOJzvaj44/Tgb-hNSxBwI/AAAAAAAAABs/baRi7vX9YCE/s320/1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />With the subject layer selected, navigate to the menu in which the &#8220;Photofy&#8221; script is registered.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TfMu_L4Sgzw/Tgb-hx17ebI/AAAAAAAAABw/-Qz_f-nxCkU/s1600/2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TfMu_L4Sgzw/Tgb-hx17ebI/AAAAAAAAABw/-Qz_f-nxCkU/s320/2.png" width="262" /></a></div><br />The dialogue box that I specified in the script-fu code segment at the bottom of the script will appear and allow the user to enter the size of the white margin.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9IyK0kdIzaQ/Tgb-iM-92pI/AAAAAAAAAB0/iDouukMupfw/s1600/3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="170" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9IyK0kdIzaQ/Tgb-iM-92pI/AAAAAAAAAB0/iDouukMupfw/s320/3.png" width="320" /></a></div><br />When you press &#8220;OK&#8221;, the script will run through its actions and the user&#8217;s environment will remain the same, and the there will be a single new undo step in the history.<br />This is the final product:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZiLNMJ8g7iw/Tgb-ixVI8mI/AAAAAAAAAB4/o6nCg1vhxME/s1600/4.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="284" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZiLNMJ8g7iw/Tgb-ixVI8mI/AAAAAAAAAB4/o6nCg1vhxME/s320/4.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>The code:</b> <br /><br />If you&#8217;re interested in seeing what the code looks like, or want to use the script yourself (either as is, or as a baseline to write you own), it is available here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/Gimp-Python-Fu/blob/master/photofy.py">https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/Gimp-Python-Fu/blob/master/photofy.py</a>

So it turns out bash has a vi mode!<br />(Can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t know about this earlier)<br /><br />To enable vi mode, just type this into your shell:<br /><blockquote style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">$&gt; set -o vi</blockquote><br />That will enable it for this shell so you can try it out, and if you like it, add that line to your <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">~/.bashrc</span> file for future.<br /><br />One really useful vi-mode command is pressing &#8217;<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">v</span>&#8217; from command mode. This will put your current command line into vim to modify. <br /><br />To get more help on the commands available in vi-mode, take a look at the bottom of this man page:<br /><blockquote style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">$&gt; man 3 readline</blockquote><br />To get more information on the various options available for bash, take a look at:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">$&gt; help set</span></blockquote><br />I&#8217;m going to give it ago in the coming weeks to see if its actually useful or not. <br /><br />So far, I&#8217;ve found one small annoyance, I use ctrl+l to clear the terminal, but with the vi key bindings enabled, this only works from command mode (you have to hit <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ESC</span> first).<br />To fix this, I added this to my <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">~/.bashrc</span> file:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">bind -m vi-insert &#8216;Control-l: clear-screen&#8217;</span></blockquote><br />These commands could also be added to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/etc/inputrc</span>, but I&#8217;m happy to leave these 2 lines together in my <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">~/.bashrc</span> so its easier to remember.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
If you&#8217;ve ever used PhpMyAdmin before, you&#8217;ll know it can be quite handy, especially for people like me who always forget SQL&#8217;s syntax.<br />I even use it for simple tasks just so I can see what SQL it generated and it even has a handy &#8220;Create PHP Code&#8221; button to give me a baseline to start hacking the query to suit my situation.<br /><br />This is great for local setups, but sometimes I need to do a query a production database where PhpMyAdmin is not installed and its alot easier to inspect the data of big tables with a gui (at least for me anyway).<br /><br />Another helpful tip that I picked up from my new work place (thanks Rich) is to make PhpMyAdmin connect to a remote database via an SSH tunnel.<br />It requires a small config change to PhpMyAdmin, but it works a charm!<br /><br />To differentiate between a tunnelled database and the local one, you need to configure your web server to serve up PhpMyAdmin from an additional URL, such as <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">http://localhost/php<b>remote</b>admin</span> in addition to the standard <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</span>.<br /><br />I added a second alias for PhpMyAdmin in <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf</span> to look like this:<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Alias /phpmyadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin<br />Alias /phpremoteadmin /usr/share/phpmyadmin</blockquote><br />Then, I modified my <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php</span> to include this:<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">// If phpremoteadmin is requested, use an ssh tunnel on 6666<br />// Note: This doesn&#8217;t create the tunnel, use ~/bin/mysql_remote<br />if (substr_count($_SERVER[&#8220;REQUEST_URI&#8221;], &#8220;phpremoteadmin&#8221;) &gt; 0) {<br />$cfg[&#8216;Servers&#8217;][$i][&#8216;connect_type&#8217;] = &#8216;tcp&#8217;;<br />$cfg[&#8216;Servers&#8217;][$i][&#8216;port&#8217;] = &#8216;6666&#8217;;<br />$cfg[&#8216;Servers&#8217;][$i][&#8216;host&#8217;] = &#8216;127.0.0.1&#8217;;<br />}</blockquote><br />Basically that means if the request is for <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">/phpremoteadmin</span>, look for the database on port 6666 instead of the preconfigured database port.<br /><br />You&#8217;l have to reload apache for these changes to take effect:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload</span></blockquote><br />Then you need a SSH tunnel from your local port 6666 to the servers port 3306 (where mysql is normally listening). To create this tunnel, you can use:<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ssh -L 6666:localhost:3306 $USER@$HOST</blockquote><br />But, to make it easier, I use (a slight variation) of this script:<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">#!/bin/sh<br /><br />if [ $# -lt 1 ] || [ $# -gt 2 ]; then<br />&nbsp; echo &#8220;Usage: $0 host1 [host2]&#8221;<br />&nbsp; exit 2<br />fi<br /><br />USER=&#8221;steve&#8221;<br />HOST=$1<br /><br />DBHOST=&#8221;localhost&#8221;<br />[ -z &#8220;$2&#8221; ] || DBHOST=&#8221;$2&#8221;<br /><br />echo &#8220;Browse to: http://localhost/phpremoteadmin&#8221;<br />ssh -L 6666:$DBHOST:3306 $USER@$HOST</blockquote><br />The script also allows you to pass in an optional argument of the host where the database is.<br />By default, that is localhost (the remote server&#8217;s localhost). <br />This is useful if you can only ssh to a gateway server and the database is on another server within that remote network that you wouldn&#8217;t normally be able to ssh directly to.<br /><br />This has been really helpful, so I wanted to share :)

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>E212: Can&#8217;t open file for writing  <br/>Press ENTER or type command to continue</p></blockquote>


<p>If you use <code>vim</code>, you have probably come across this error before.<br/>
It normally happens when you don&rsquo;t have permission to write to your chosen destination.</p>

<p>The temporary solution has traditionally been to save your changes to somewhere where you do have permissions (such as <code>/tmp</code> or <code>~</code>), then use <code>sudo</code> to <code>cp</code> it across, or re-open the file in vim with <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<p>A collegue at work showed me a great trick to get around this when it happens (Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/rich0H">@rich0H</a>). All you have to do is add this to your <code>.vimrc</code> file:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>.vimrc </span></figcaption>
<div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>command! W w !sudo tee % &gt; /dev/null</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then when you come across this error again, instead of of using <code>:w</code> you can use <code>:W</code> and it will prompt you for your <code>sudo</code> password before saving.</p>

<p>Works brilliantly!</p>

<a href="http://www.dddmelbourne.com/">DDD Melbourne</a> was on at Swinburne Uni on last weekend and a couple of friends and I went along.<br /><br />This event was more targeted at Microsoft technologies, but there was a bit of other stuff to keep me interested.<br />I got to see some pretty neat JavaScript stuff, learned a thing or two about the vast range of Microsoft technologies, got to re-visit Android 101 and eat plenty of junk food!<br />I love that us nerds love pizza and cake! :)<br /><br />Now as good as the day was, the topic I picked to blog about actually has nothing to do with the content of any of the talks.<br />This is partially because a fair amount of the MS tech stuff went over my head, but more to do with the website that I&#8217;m about to talk about is something I might consider for my own use in the future.<br /><br />One of the speakers had a really neat presentation that kept the audiences attention with fancy transitions and clever choice of images and at the end of the presentation, we found out that it was all done through a site called <a href="http://prezi.com/">prezi.com</a><br /><br />Anyway, instead of me ranting on about it, it really has to be seen.<br />Here is a quick &#8220;Prezi&#8221; I knocked up, but this doesn&#8217;t compare to the impressive prezi I saw at DDD:<br /><a href="http://prezi.com/8p2z_a_ua4mh/my-first-prezi/">http://prezi.com/8p2z_a_ua4mh/my-first-prezi/</a><br /><br />Browsing through the community prezi&#8217;s would probably give you a better Idea :)<br /><a href="http://prezi.com/8p2z_a_ua4mh/my-first-prezi/"><br /></a>

There are plenty of ways of doing a search and replace in multiple files in linux, but this is how I do it with vim.<br /><blockquote style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">$&gt; vim firstfile secondfile theothers*<br />:all<br />:windo %s/this/that/g</blockquote><br />The <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:all</span> will split the window to show you all the files at once.<br />This would not be the best option for lots of files, but for a small number you get to see the changes that are made. <br />The <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:windo</span> will execute the given command for all the files in the current window.<br />Note this wont affect windows in other tabs.<br /><br />If you want to undo that change in all buffers, you can use the same method:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:windo undo</span></blockquote>When your finished, you can save and quit with:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:wqall</span></blockquote>There are plenty of variations, for more infomation checkout the help pages for these:<br /><blockquote><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:tabdo</div><div style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:bufdo</div><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">:argdo</span></blockquote>

By default, the indicator applet in the Unity panel has an item in the list for evolution and another for empathy - two programs I don&#8217;t use!<br /><br />But, its quite easy to get rid of them! All you have to do is remove the appropriate file in /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications<br /><br />Instead of removing them, I just removed all read permissions (root can still do anything with it of course)<br /><blockquote>$ cd /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications<br />$ sudo chmod 000 empathy evolution</blockquote>

I&#8217;m now using  Ubuntu 11.04 with Unity as my primary OS for my desktop at work.<br />I&#8217;m still coming to grips with Unity - somethings I like, others I don&#8217;t. <br /><br />One of the things I do like is the compiz plugin called &#8220;Grid&#8221;.<br />At first I thought it was just a clone of Windows 7 where you can drag a window to the left and it will fill the left half of the screen, drag it to the top and it will maximize, but after taking a look at the key bindings it does a bit more!<br /><br />Using alt + ctrl + the number pad, you get more options!<br />Alt+ctrl+4 will make the window fill the left half (like dragging), 6 will do right, 8 will do the top half, 2 will do the bottom half and 7, 9, 1 and 3 will put the window in the appropriate corner, 5 will put it in the middle and 0 will maximize it.<br />On top of this, if you press the key repeatedly it will adjust from 1/2 screen, to a 1/3, to 1/4, to 3/4 and to 2/3. This is surprisingly easy to use and really helpful!<br /><br />The only thing I couldn&#8217;t work out how to do was move a window from one monitor to the other as these actions occur per monitor (i.e. 1/2 of one screen).<br /><br />The answer was quite easy though, I just needed to enable one more plugin: &#8220;Put&#8221;.<br />The &#8220;Put&#8221; plugin looks like it does similar actions to &#8220;Grid&#8221;, so before I enabled it, I disabled all the key bindings (there was only about 2 enabled anyway).<br />Then I set the keyboard binding for &#8220;Put To Next Output&#8221; to &#8220;&lt;Control&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;KPEnter&#8221;.<br /><br />When I enabled it, the Unity panel got a little screwed up (which is evidently not hard to break), so I restarted X and everything worked how I expected it to.<br />Now atl+ctrl+keypad-enter will move the window between my left monitor and my right monitor!

So my brother Rob and I have wanted to work on a project together for a while now, and after our awesome <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/04/minecraft-and-arch-linux-ftw.html">Minecraft Server</a>, we came to the realization that I love doing the functional side of things (setting up the software, etc.) and Rob loves doing the creative, hands-on side of things (putting the hardware together and making it look pro) and so together, this things compliment each other!<br /><br />After scoring a <a href="http://netduino.com/">Netduino</a> (like an Arduino, but I write in C#.net instead of C) for use in a future project, this was the perfect opportunity for our skills to come together as Rob isn&#8217;t keen on programming, and I&#8217;m probably not as good as him at making things, whereas he is quite passionate about that!<br /><br />I&#8217;ve always wanted to have a play with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a> (or Netduino in this case). To actually allow my interest in programming to bridge across to the  hardware world always seemed like a mystical unknown to me, but these  little programmable micro-controllers allow just that - my software to  use hardware!<br /><br />Enter <a href="http://tank.stevenocchipinti.com/"><i>The Tank Project</i></a>!<br /><br />The idea was to build a physical tank that we can use the Netduino to control, but not just limited to controlling the movement of the tank, but then a variety of other features.<br />Things that came to mind were a working (not-so-dangerous, legal) canon, webcam feeds for remote control, mobile application to drive it, 360 degree spinning turret and just about anything else we could think of!<br />Our imagination started going wild with vague memories back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Wars">Robot Wars</a> and so we set aside a day to brainstorm ideas and develop a plan of attack (pardon the pun). That day was yesterday, and it went well! :)<br /><br />We&#8217;re going to try to keep a project blog going if you want to keep track of the progress:<br /><a href="http://tank.stevenocchipinti.com/">http://tank.stevenocchipinti.com</a><br /><br />(&#8220;keep <i>track</i> of the progress&#8221; is also a pun&#8230; theres going to be a few of these, lol!)
