Every time I go on holiday, I end up writing the same bash script! &#8230; I know, how nerdy is that, I code on holidays.<br /><br />I really should save the script and bring it with me each time, instead I just re-invent the wheel everytime, so I thought I would write a quick post to record it for next time.<br />Luckily it&#8217;s a really simple script to write, all it does is move the photos from my camera&#8217;s memory card to the laptop HDD, but it puts them in a sub-directory for that particular day, then sorts the files into a &#8216;jpg&#8217; or &#8216;raw&#8217; sub-directory.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4453912.js"></script>The script is quite dumb, it just creates a directory for the current date. On one of the trips, I had the script pull the date the photo was taken from the EXIF information, but when a series of photos goes over mid-night, it splits them up and I didn&#8217;t really like that.

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>A little while ago, my brother got me a photography course as a gift, so I asked a friend of mine, Amy, to join me and last Thursday night we attended the course. The course was a &ldquo;Night Landscape&rdquo; tutorial where we all brought our own cameras and a professional photographer guides us through how to take photos at night. The class was quite small, it consisted of Amy and I with one other student.</p>

<p>The course started out quite basic and we went though some fundamental theory, a lot of which Amy and I already knew, but the other student was a little less experienced so the photographer needed to cater for all of us.<br/>
Luckily it was just a small class, because instead of following the standard course structure, the photographer spent more time in conversations with us, answering all our specific questions.</p>

<p>Being self-taught, I am grateful for that, because these conversations were what lead me to learn a few new things that I hadn&rsquo;t picked up in my own research so far.<br/>
Here is a quick summary of the things I learned:</p>

<h2>1. Blowing out the sky, intentionally</h2>

<p>The first new tip I learned was a trick the photographer used when the scene has an unusable sky, such as a dull cloud cover (like last night in the rain). He would take another photo that was intentionally over-exposed so the sky was as white as possible. By doing this, afterwards in Photoshop a pure white sky is very easy to select, even through the leaves of a tree or someone&rsquo;s hair using tools like the magic wand, or a color-based selection and can be replaced with a more dramatic sky from another shoot.</p>

<h2>2. Hand-holding at night</h2>

<p>At night, it is normally quite hard to take photos without blurring the shot unless you have a tripod, but there is a simple rule of thumb that can help with selecting an appropriate shutter speed:</p>

<blockquote><p>Make the denominator of the shutter speed match the focal length</p></blockquote>


<p>So if you are shooting at a 20mm focal length, the shutter speed should be about 1/20. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t a perfect rule, but it is a great place to start and you can adjust from there.</p>

<h2>3. Freezing human motion</h2>

<p>So the previous tip will make it easy to minimize any blur from yourself when holding the camera, but that wont help with people in your shot moving around. Well this photographer recommends:</p>

<blockquote><p>Use a shutter speed of 1/125 as a baseline to freeze human motion</p></blockquote>


<p>It turns out that most movement from people is slow enough for this shutter speed to capture it sharply, and of course you can adjust as necessary.</p>

<h2>4. Filters to allow for more creativity</h2>

<p>So far the only filters I have used are a &ldquo;Circular Polariser&rdquo; to enhance sky&rsquo;s, cut out reflections, etc. and a &ldquo;UV&rdquo; filter to protect the lens. Our photographer had quite an impressive set of filters and gave us a demo of his &ldquo;Neutral Density&rdquo; (or &ldquo;ND&rdquo;) filter and a &ldquo;Graduated Blue-Yellow&rdquo; filter.<br/>
Long exposures can look really good at night, but they are normally impossible during the day, but with the ND filter, not much light gets through, so long exposures are needed even during the day. Our photographer had a street art photo with blurred clouds and deep dark colors in the middle of the day - it looked fantastic!<br/>
The &ldquo;Graduated Blue-Yellow&rdquo; filter changes the color of the light that comes through, and in this case, it enhances the blue colors of a sky at the top of the shot and the earthy yellow tones of the ground on the bottom of the shot. I had only ever known these colors to be improved like this with the use of software, but these filters had a great effect straight from the camera.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So at the end of the day, the course was quite basic, but in our tangential conversations I gained some pretty cool tips and tricks.<br/>
I think the most valuable aspect of a course like this is not so much the material presented, but just to experience another photographers style. It&rsquo;s always interesting to see how everyone thinks about things in their own unique way, and going through other peoples photos with a conversation is really intriguing.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rob and Sarah for the gift and Amy for keeping me company!</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>I was toying with the idea of making my own &ldquo;Car Computer&rdquo; and one of the crucial parts is a Bluetooth connection, but not for P2P file transfer (although that could be useful), I would want this computer to appear the same way a Bluetooth stereo or headset does, so once connected it will stream the audio from my phone through the car speakers. Turns out it&rsquo;s quite easy with Ubuntu :)</p>

<p>PulseAudio is pretty awesome!<br/>
First step is ensure Pulse has the Bluetooth module loaded (mine did by default), you can check this by looking at this file <code>/etc/pulse/default.pa</code></p>

<p>The next step is to configure the Bluetooth daemon to enable <code>Source</code> (and/or <code>Gateway</code> mode).<br/>
To do this, I added the following line to <code>/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">Enable</span><span class="o">=</span>Gateway,Source,Socket
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then restart the Bluetooth daemon:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$&gt; sudo service bluetooth restart</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you&rsquo;ll have to pair the computer with the phone as per normal.<br/>
Once the devices are paired, an <code>Audio Source</code> connection needs to be created.<br/>
For this, the easiest way is via DBus, but so we don&rsquo;t have to write a script, an easy way to test this in an ad-hoc manner is to use a tool called <code>d-feet</code>, which is available in the Ubuntu repos.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$&gt; sudo apt-get install d-feet</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using <code>d-feet</code>, navigate to the <code>system bus</code> and find the <code>org.bluez</code> key.<br/>
In here, there will be another key that has a device number in it.<br/>
(for me this was <code>/org/bluez/1002/hci0/dev_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx</code>)<br/>
Under this key, execute <code>org.bluez.AudioSource &gt; methods &gt; Connect()</code> without any parameters and your phone should now indicate that it is connected to the computer as an audio device.</p>

<p>At this point, I started playing some music so I could tell when it was working, but you probably won&rsquo;t be able to hear anything just yet.<br/>
That is because Pulse does not automatically send every source to every output - that could get messy!<br/>
To configure pulse to send the audio from the Bluetooth connection to your speakers you need to determine the name of the audio source and the name of the &ldquo;<em>sink</em>&rdquo; (or output) and join them together.<br/>
You can do this with the PulseAudio shell like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$&gt; pacmd
</span><span class='line'>&gt;&gt;&gt; list-sources
</span><span class='line'>&gt;&gt;&gt; list-sinks
</span><span class='line'>&gt;&gt;&gt; load-module module-loopback source=bluez_source.xxxx sink=alsa_output.pci-xxxx</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(Replace the <code>source=</code> and <code>sink=</code> parts with the names from the preceding two commands)</p>

<p>Now all audio from your phone should be streaming through your computer.<br/>
DBus makes it really simple to do this programmatically, so it could easily be (mostly) automated and even controlled by a nice touch friendly GUI to pick the source device, etc.</p>

<p>I thought I would write up a quick post on this because when I finally got my music streaming through my laptop, it was exciting to know that I could actually use this to make a car computer with bluetooth functionality quite easily.<br/>
I used <code>AudioSource</code> in this example, but the other fun option is the <code>HandsFreeGateway</code>, where instead of streaming stereo sound for music, it will also connect the microphone from the computer to the phone to be used in-call, etc.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve been using Ruby on Rails for about a year and half now and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it! At the time of writing (at least in Melbourne) there is lots of demand for Rubyist&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s great time to get involved.<br/>
I have a couple of friends who are interested in making the switch from Java to Ruby so I wrote them an email with some pointers on how to get started and then realized it would make a good blog post :)</p>

<h2>Join the community!</h2>

<p>Ruby and Rails are quite well known for their excellent communities, so the first step is to join your local group. For us in Australia, that group is <em>Ruby On Rails Oceania</em> (aka RORO).<br/>
They have meetups on the <em>last Thursday of every month</em> in Melbourne and a pretty active mailing list:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#%21forum/rails-oceania">Ruby On Rails Oceania Mailing List</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ruby.org.au/">Ruby.org.au</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Ruby and Rails resources:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a> - I use these almost everyday!</li>
<li><a href="http://apidock.com/">ApiDock</a> - API&rsquo;s for Ruby, Rails and RSpec in one place</li>
<li><a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails For Zombies</a> - A great beginners tutorial for rails</li>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">Rails Casts</a> - Regular video podcast all about rails</li>
<li><a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/">Ruby5</a> - Regular 5 minute audio podcast on the latest news</li>
<li>&hellip; a plethora of good books, such as &ldquo;The RSpec Book&rdquo;, &ldquo;Design Patterns in Ruby&rdquo;, etc. (alot of which I still need to read)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting started:</h2>

<p>To get started you&rsquo;ll need to set up your development environment, here&rsquo;s what I use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vim&hellip; of course&hellip; although there are lots of alternatives, the most popular ones would probably be:

<ul>
<li>RubyMine (IDE) - used alot at work (commercial software)</li>
<li>Sublime Text 2 (Text editor)</li>
<li>TextMate (Text editor)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RVM (Ruby Version Manager)

<ul>
<li>Get from here: <a href="https://rvm.io/">https://rvm.io</a></li>
<li>Follow the instructions to configure your shell to use RVM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use RVM to install the latest ruby

<ul>
<li><code>rvm install 1.9.3</code></li>
<li>A newer alternative to RVM is RBenv</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you have ruby installed, you will have the &lsquo;gem&rsquo; command available

<ul>
<li>Gems are roughly equivalent to jars in the Java world</li>
<li>Use gem to install the latest rails

<ul>
<li><code>gem install rails</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you have rails installed, you will have the &lsquo;rails&rsquo; command available

<ul>
<li>Use the rails command to start a new project

<ul>
<li><code>rails new todolist</code></li>
<li><code>rails server</code></li>
<li>browse to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now you can read the readme, the rails guides and make a simple app with scaffolding!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Things to keep in mind for RoR dev:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rails is just a framework written in Ruby, so it will help to learn some straight Ruby too.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">ruby-lang.org</a> is a good place to start</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails strongly supports DRY principles

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, theres problably a gem that already does what you want</li>
<li>To find gems, good places to look are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby-Toolbox.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The majority of Ruby projects are:

<ul>
<li>Developed using TDD/BDD, so you&rsquo;ll need to learn the testing frameworks:

<ul>
<li>Test::Unit (default with rails)</li>
<li>RSpec (a popular replacement for Test::Unit)</li>
<li>Cucumber (BDD)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developed on MacOSX - for new comers (like myself) some essentials are:

<ul>
<li>brew - a mac package manager (like apt or yum)</li>
<li>iterm2 - really good terminal emulator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deployed on Linux

<ul>
<li>Basic Linux foo is really useful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Version controlled with git

<ul>
<li>If you need to learn git, I highly recommend <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro git</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s a quick overview of what I can recommend to get going based on my own experience, things will obviously change over time, and others may have other opinions, if so feel free to leave comments below.</p>

At the end of June this year, I upgraded from a HTC Desire HD to a Samsung Galaxy S3, so I thought after a couple of months of having my new phone I should write up a (really long) post on what stood out for me.<br /><br /><br /><b>The positive</b> <br /><br />The <b>screen and form factor</b> is awesome! Due to the plastic body and the thin shape, this phone is really light and slips into your pocket nicely. The massive 4.8&#8221; screen really shines when watching videos and browsing the web. I regularly watch screencasts on my phone and the 1280x720 resolution gives me plenty of detail. The colour contrast is a lot higher than my previous phone, which makes the blacks look really deep and videos stand out nicely. The marketing video that the phone comes with does demo it off quite well!<br /><br />The <b>battery </b>is fairly good. My requirement for battery life is that I can use it all day and by the time I get home / go to bed, it hasn&#8217;t died. Not a high expectation, I know, but these days its hard to expect more. This phone meets that requirement quite easily. On the days I don&#8217;t use my phone much, I get home after a days work with more than 50% remaining (which is huge compared to my last phone!) and on the days I use it quite heavily, I get home to about 30%-40% which easily lasts me the rest of the night. My usage generally includes syncing gmail, facebook, twitter, weather, RSS reader, work email (during peak hours), I am generally connected to wifi most of the time and I regularly browse the web and watch videos / listen to podcasts during my commute.<br /><br />The general<b> responsiveness</b> is miles ahead of my last phone too! Day-to-day usage is smooth and rarely experience any lag. This will be improved even more when Jellybean is released (rumoured to be soon!).<br /><br /><b>&#8220;Smart Stay&#8221; </b>is a new innovative feature from Samsung where just before the screen is about to timeout and turn off, the phone will take a photo of you with the front-facing camera and use face (or eye) detection to work out if you&#8217;re still looking at it. If you are, it will keep it on for another minute or so, if you&#8217;re not, then it will dim the screen and check again soon after, which then will actually turn it off.<br />This is to avoid that randomly-scrolling-to-avoid-the-screen-turning-off trick that most people will do when reading a long article. Thankfully, this feature is quite effective and I haven&#8217;t needed to do that for a while, although it doesn&#8217;t work very well in the dark!<br /><br />In the settings, there is a section called <b>&#8220;Motion&#8221;</b>. I won&#8217;t go through all of the options, as there are about 10 different ones, but some are quite handy. By far the best one IMHO is <b>&#8220;Direct call&#8221;</b>, which lets you directly call a contact whose call log details, contact details or message details are displayed on the screen by simply putting the phone to your ear from that screen. Feels very natural.<br />Another nice one is <b>&#8220;Smart alert&#8221;</b>, which will give a little vibration when you pick it up from a stationary location if you have a missed call or sms.<br /><br />The <b>camera</b> on this phone is not too bad either. Obviously it will never replace my dSLR, but it has some nice features that even my dSLR doesn&#8217;t have. The burst fire mode is really quick, but Samsung have introduced a feature called <b>&#8220;best shot&#8221;</b>, which will analyse each of the photos you took in the burst and pick the ones it thinks turned out the best, based on focus and face detection. You can adjust what was picked, and then the others are automatically discarded (saves you having to go through the 14 bad ones and delete them later).<br />The camera has a <b>built-in HDR</b> mode which works quite well too and the <b>photo editor</b> provides heaps of enhancements and corrections, including red-eye reduction, color balance, cropping, etc.<br /><br />Another nice feature is found in the video player, it has a <b>&#8220;pop-out&#8221;</b> button! This means that if you&#8217;re in the middle of a video and you wanted to quickly google something, or reply to an sms, you can just pop out the video, which turns the full screen player into a small, floating, always on top window that you can drag around, do what you need to do, and then make it full screen again. Not something that I&#8217;ve needed to use very often, but on the rare occasion I have, it&#8217;s been quite nice.<br /><br />I use my calendar religiously and on my older HTC, the default app looked nice, but didn&#8217;t have many features. I ended up swapping it out for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=netgenius.bizcal&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Business Calendar Free</a> just so I could get a month view with text, instead of indicators.<br />The stock Samsung calendar, <b>S Planner</b>, however is not too bad! It integrates with their S Memo, which I don&#8217;t use, but comes with a good number of viewing options, my favourites being their month view and analogue week view. It also has a nice <b>&#8220;Quick add&#8221; </b>feature that lets you enter &#8220;Dinner at Nandos tomorrow 7:30pm&#8221; and it does what you&#8217;d expect. This doesn&#8217;t support anywhere near as much as Google Calendar does, but its better than nothing!<br /><br />I lashed out and bought an <b>official Samsung Desktop Dock</b>, and comparing this to my cheap eBay special I bought for my HTC, not only does it look quite nice, but it automatically launches the desktop clock app when I dock it and after 5 minutes it dims the screen and hides the other UI elements other than the clock. I like this feature a lot because I otherwise don&#8217;t have a clock in my room, so its really handy for me!<br /><br /><br />As with all things, there are pro&#8217;s and con&#8217;s. Here are some of the things I don&#8217;t like. <br /><br /><br /><b>The negative</b><br /><br />Android have decided to <b>remove USB Mass Storage mode</b> (my biggest pet hate with Android right now!) This leaves you with 3 alternative options for copying files to and from the device: Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), Camera mode or using an app such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.swift.app.kiesair&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Kies Air</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xcxin.filexpert&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInhjeGluLmZpbGV4cGVydCJd" target="_blank">File Expert</a>.<br />MTP and Camera mode both don&#8217;t give you access to all the directories on the phone, but for just transferring media it should be ok. Note that MTP will work out of the box with Windows, but if you run Mac or Linux like me, you will need to install software to get it to work (and Linux is a pain for this!).<br />The reason for this change is because USB Mass Storage mode will mean you have to unmount the partition from the system in order to mount it to the computer, whereas MTP will allow you to access it in both places at once, but its slower and requires software.<br />For phones like the Galaxy Nexus, this makes sense as there is only one partition, but with the S3, I would like to see the option of just unmounting the memory card (with is separate from the system storage) and allow that to work with USB Mass Storage mode.<br /><br />Another annoying thing I have found with this phone is sometimes the <b>home screen will randomly die</b>. This causes lag while all the widgets reinitialise themselves. It doesn&#8217;t happen often, but when it does, its annoying considering its a simple software issue. Hopefully this is fixed with Jellybean release!<br /><br />On a related note, I find the random delay between pressing the <b>unlock button</b> and the screen actually turning on to be annoying too, considering my older HTC was basically instantaneous everytime, this phone seems to vary quite a lot. I find myself pressing the button while its still in my pocket, just so by the time I have it in front of me, the screen is ready.<br /><br />A couple of other minor things include the <b>notification LED</b> being really bright, which is ok, but while the phone is docked my bedside, it will light up the entire room quite easily. This is kind of funny considering &#8220;smart stay&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work well at night. Maybe instead of just green and red, the LED should have also included an IR LED for that.<br />Not only is the LED really bright, but when the battery becomes fully charged, it will turn on the screen and popup a notification, which is also not very nice when I&#8217;m trying to sleep.<br />I know most of you are probably thinking a solution would be to turn it off at night, but I <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/03/xkcd-beyondpod.html" target="_blank">scheduled my phone to download podcasts</a> during these hours with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">BeyondPod</a> - I think the pro&#8217;s outweigh the con&#8217;s in this situation.<br /><br />Also minor, but there is <b>no stock flashlight app</b>, which I wanted to put in the lock screen shortcuts. It does come with a 2x1 widget, but to get a shortcut on the lock screen, I ended up downloading one of the million flashlight apps out there.<br /><br />Speaking of widgets, the HTC widgets were really nice, but I find the <b>widgets</b> that came with the Samsung are not quite as useful, luckily they are in abundance on the play store too!<br /><br /><br /><b>The other stuff</b><br /><br />Here are some other noteworthy things which I haven&#8217;t really made up my mind if I like yet or not.<br /><br />The music player has a feature called <b>&#8220;Music Square&#8221;</b> and I love the idea of it, but I&#8217;m not sure how effective it is. Basically you index your music library and it categorises each of your songs into 2 scales: <i>&#8216;Exciting</i> to <i>Calm&#8217;</i> and <i>&#8216;Passionate</i> to <i>Joyful</i>&#8217;. These two scales make up the axes of the music square and by tapping where your mood is will play those types of songs. It&#8217;s a great idea and I need to experiment with it more to see how effective it is.<br /><br />A lot of the features in the phone are <b>voice activated</b>. For example, you can say <i>&#8216;answer&#8217;</i> or <i>&#8216;reject&#8217;</i> when it is ringing (as long as the ringtone isn&#8217;t too loud); <i>&#8216;snooze&#8217;</i> or <i>&#8216;stop&#8217;</i> when the alarm is going off (as long as thats not too loud); <i>&#8216;smile&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;cheese&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;capture&#8217;</i> or <i>&#8216;shoot&#8217;</i> to take a photo (as long as your close enough for the phone to hear you); <i>&#8216;next&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;previous&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;pause&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;play&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;volume&#8217;</i>, etc. to control your music or the radio (as long as thats not too loud either).<br />As you can see, the usefulness of these features are dependant on the environment.<br /><br /><b>S Voice</b> is Samsung&#8217;s answer to Siri, and even the UI&#8217;s look similar, but while its great in theory, I think the most useful thing about Siri on the iPhone or S Voice on the Galaxy would be SMS/email dictation, but that is the one thing these features don&#8217;t work that well for, at least for me anyway - maybe its just my voice!<br /><br /><br /><b>The conclusion</b><br /><br />In the end I am very happy with my new phone, it is leaps and bounds above my old phone, its really responsive other than the random home screen lag and unlock button delay, it has some nice new innovative features and is a joy to use.<br />Also, with the Jellybean release (hopefully) around the corner, it can only get better.

  <p>In the old days, printing was really hard in linux. It was one of the things that was a deal breaker when trying to switch from Windows for a lot of people, but when I first tried Ubuntu (probably around 2006-2007) it made all that pain go away! It was easy! A couple of clicks and you could set up a network printer and its been that easy ever since.</p>

<p>Recently Ubuntu have tried to make their settings screen a bit like a Mac, and to simplify everything they seem to be using a simplified user interface for the printer configuration too:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx9JrDkVYrk/UB3w_5N77aI/AAAAAAAAAKY/5HHdw8ZErB0/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:37.png" title="New Settings user interface" >
<img class="center" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xO2uGM8R36A/UB3xME_iwZI/AAAAAAAAAKg/kBFbC_MDcv8/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:55.png" title="New Printing user interface" ></p>

<p>Well this new interface doesn&rsquo;t work for me, when I try to add a network printer, I get the error message:</p>

<blockquote><p>FirewallD is not running. Network printer detection needs services mdns, ipp, ipp-client and samba-client enabled on firewall.</p></blockquote>


<p><img class="center" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpSMga_I2I/UB3xOZVzlDI/AAAAAAAAAKo/4_KILPWTWTg/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A03%253A44.png" title="The error that stops me from finding my network printer" ></p>

<p>Well no matter what I did, I couldn&rsquo;t add my printer. After some googling around, I found how to get to the old user interface&hellip; which actually works!
Just type this into a terminal:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo system-config-printer</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And you will be given this old familiar screen:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SnoWmsgEnX0/UB3xQWJYmhI/AAAAAAAAAK4/LCbtVTqQFZE/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A04%253A55.png" title="The classic printing user interface... the one that works!" ></p>

<p>Clicking the big &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button in this screen and following the steps worked great for me. Another alternative is to use the CUPS web interface on <a href="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</a> but that can be a little more complicated.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;ve had an interest in electronics since a very young age, but I never really went further than building simple circuits as a kid and learning the theory and following diagrams through school.<br/>
There&rsquo;s always the odd repair job, and plenty of theoretical knowledge from family, friends and university, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to design the electronics of anything complex.</p>

<p>A little while back, a <a href="http://michael.chandler.id.au/">friend of mine</a> got an email from <a href="http://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> with suggested meetups. One of them was the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hackduino-Electronics-Meetup-Group">Melbourne Hackduino</a> meetup.<br/>
So he forwarded it on to our group of friends and a few of us went along to check it out. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play with a microprocessor, but never really put the time aside for it. Being a software developer there was always this barrier between the programs I write and making them do something in the real world.</p>

<p>Well, in the last week that barrier has been lifted! The meetup was great and hearing about other people&rsquo;s hobbies and projects provides plenty of motivation! We heard stories about everything from people trying to optimize solar hot water systems to building full size mechanical avatars. It was a lot of fun!</p>

<p><a href="http://au.linkedin.com/pub/mark-butt/28/507/539">Mark Butt</a>, the organiser of the event gave us a presentation of <a href="http://www.springrocket.com.au/portfolio/">some of the cool things he has done in the past</a>, such as an arduino powered bar counter top that detects what drink you put on it and a run down of some of the things he plans on doing in the future, all very cool!</p>

<p>One really nice bonus was the generous offering from <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/">Freetronics</a>. There were a few people from Freetronics at the event and other than being very knowledgeable, they brought a big bunch of assorted hardware to give away! They had everything from RGB LEDs to full blown Arduino boards.<br/>
I was lucky enough to score an <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/products/ethermega-arduino-mega-2560-compatible-with-onboard-ethernet#.UA3bC3AwyGo">EtherMega 2650</a>, which from what I can tell is a beefed up Arduino with an Ethernet port (with power over Ethernet) and a MicroSD card reader. Some of my friends got a <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/products/lcd-keypad-shield#.UA4RrXAwyGp">LCD shield</a> that can display 2 rows of 16 characters and has a few buttons on board. For those that aren&rsquo;t up with the lingo, a shield is an attachment for a standard Arduino board to add functionality.</p>

<p>Together we had enough hardware to be able to make something cool! :-)<br/>
Needless to say after some great conversations about hardware hacking and being given some gear to get going, we were all pretty keen to get started hacking, so on the following Saturday three of us got together for a hack night.<br/>
The guys came around that night, we ordered pizzas and worked through the night till about 5:30 AM!   We had one experienced hardware guy, <a href="https://twitter.com/asellitt">@asellitt</a>, but the other two of us, <a href="https://twitter.com/optiks">@optiks</a> and I, were completely new to this, but between Anthony, the sample code that comes with the IDE and the Internet we picked it up pretty fast!<br/>
By the end of the night we had the first version of CarDuino!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HACD/CarDuino">CarDuino</a> is a simple game where you hold the screen in portrait orientation and move your car from side to side to avoid obstacles.  It&rsquo;s a very simple game, and we have plenty more features in mind for the future, but it was a great first project!</p>

<p>After sleeping in till about lunch time there next day, I wanted to put my EtherMega to use, so I spent the rest of the day fiddling with that.   With network access, power over Ethernet and a card reader, this is a perfect platform for controlling things via a web interface. As my background is web development, this was right up my alley!   Using various sample code, I put together a <a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/ArduinoWebServer">really basic web server</a> that can respond to different requests and serve files from its built in memory card reader.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ezXsvJSsgHc/UAvmjO-JnGI/AAAAAAAAAKE/oZ6v5viAgzQ/20120722_213551.png" title="My Freetronics EtherMega 2560 serving files from the memory card on a webserver!" ></p>

<p>In just a few days, we went from no Arduino experience to a working project (or two). Especially with basic programming experience, the entry level for getting into Arduino is really low. When you buy (or build) a board and download the software, you have enough sample code with the IDE to make things happen, and you can get a lot done by simply copying and pasting!</p>

<p>I recommend having a play with this stuff, its really fun and more than likely, one day you will come across a problem that you will be able to solve with an Arduino!</p>

<div class="entry-content">
  <p>I regularly attend <a href="http://ruby.org.au/">RORO - The Ruby on Rails Oceania</a> meetups.
They currently occur on the last Thursday of every month and so naturally I put the event in my calendar. I added the usual details and then selected the &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; option and set it to repeat monthly by the day of the week.</p>

<p>This worked well for a while, until one day when I rocked up and it wasn&rsquo;t on.<br/>
A later realised that in that particular month there were 5 Thursdays instead of 4 and my calendar event was actually set to repeat <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the fourth Thursday&rdquo;</em>.<br/>
It turns out that the interface Google provide to set recurring events does not allow you to change this.. or at least not intuitively.</p>

<p>After some searching around I found a few solutions:</p>

<h2>Use English!</h2>

<p>The simplest way is to just write out the event in plain English. For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>RORO at Inspire9, Richmond on the last Thursday of every month</p></blockquote>


<p>This will create an event called &ldquo;RORO at Inspire9, Richmond&rdquo;, with the location field set to &ldquo;Inspire9, Richmond&rdquo; and the repetition set to <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the last Thursday&rdquo;.</em></p>

<h2>Start repeating from an appropriate month</h2>

<p>Another fairly easy way is to find a month that actually has 5 Thursdays and make the event start from there. This will set the recurrence to repeat <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the last Thursday&rdquo;</em>, instead of <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the fourth Thursday&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<h2>Hack the ICS</h2>

<p>This solution is probably the hardest, but because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> format does support this, you could write the code manually. To do this you would have to export the calendar to a file, hack it and import it back.<br/>
While it&rsquo;s nice to know this, seems like more effort that just typing what you want in English!</p>

<h2>A better solution</h2>

<p>.. would be if Google provided an additional option in the little &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; popup to allow this!</p>

<p>Or maybe the RORO organiser should maintain there own calendar feed that we could all subscribe to. This would also mean that if a particular meetup was moved or cancelled, all the subscribers calendars would automatically be updated!</p>

<div>Password management is one of those things that can always be improved. If anyone is using a single password for all their accounts in this day and age they are most likely going to experience trouble at some stage! This post is to outline my progression through some approaches I&#8217;ve tried starting from a very young age to present day.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #1: A tiered approach</b><br /><br />For me, the natural progression from a single password (back in primary school) was to go with a tiered approach. I used one password for for the basic sites, spam, etc. - the stuff I don&#8217;t really care about very much. I used another password for the important stuff, like Facebook, Twitter, etc. and this password was a lot stronger than the last. I had a unique and strong password for my email, as someone with access to that would most likely have the power to reset any of my other passwords. And finally I had a completely separate password for banking.<br /><br />While this system is ok, it&#8217;s not the best! Once upon a time, way back before I could touch type, I came to a password prompt, so I looked down at the keyboard, typed out my password, pressed enter and looked back up at the screen. In that time a friend had sent me an IM on MSN messenger (I know, old school!) and the chat window had stolen focus, so I sent my password to him. While I (mostly) trust my friend, in a panic, I frantically raced around to as many sites as I could to change the password to something else.<br /><br />If I had a different password for each site, this wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem. Now obviously most people wouldn&#8217;t IM their passwords to their friends, but there are lots of other ways for your passwords to get out. A few simple examples are the &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; attacks on large systems like the PSN, keyloggers, people looking over your shoulder, phishing attacks and even <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/" target="_blank">stupid websites</a> making dumb mistakes! Of course, this isn&#8217;t even thinking about what would happen if you were the target of a good hacker! &#8230; but that&#8217;ll never happen right? ;)<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #2: Patterned alterations</b><br /><br />Ok, so if I want a different password for every site I will ever use, how will I ever remember all of them. Well one simple way would be to make careful alterations to the password based on a pattern. This pattern should not be obvious by looking at a given password, but it should be reproducible based on whatever site you are trying to log in to. For example, if your normal password is &#8216;P@$sW0rd&#8217;, one pattern could produce &#8217;<u>T</u>@$sW<u>#Er</u>&#8217; for when you&#8217;re trying to log in to <u>T</u>witt<u>er</u> and &#8221;<u>F</u>@$sW<u>#Ok</u>&#8221; for when you&#8217;re trying to log in to <u>F</u>acebo<u>ok</u>.<br />I&#8217;m sure you can guess the pattern here. Everyone will have their own unique twist on patterns and this can be quite successful if executed correctly, but of course if your pattern is weak and a real person gets your Facebook password of &#8220;P@sS-facebook&#8221;, they can probably guess your twitter password would be &#8220;P@sS-twitter&#8221;.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #3: Stored, centralised and synchronised passwords</b><br /><br />Alot of people think that letting your browser remember passwords is a bad thing, and while it does have particular cons, there are some pros to it too.<br />For one, you can have completely random passwords and not have to remember them. Also, two of the methods of disclosing a password that I mentioned earlier were keyloggers and someone looking over your shoulder. Both of these scenarios are a lot less likely if your browser does the typing for you (but of course there are other considerations with this approach). The obvious con would be that if someone gets a hold of what the browser knows, they have <i>all</i> your passwords!<br /><br />Firefox provides a &#8220;master password&#8221; facility to encrypt all your passwords (one of my pet hates is that Chrome lacks this) so when a password is needed, you type in your master password once, and it will then autofill any field after that. (Just remember to lock your screen if you leave your pc unattended).<br />Special consideration to make this password super strong should obviously be taken to avoid any brute force possibilities and of course a master password can be stolen just the same, but this password is useless online and it reduces the probability of others being stolen. (1 chance to steal the master password, as opposed to many chances to steal individual passwords).<br /><br />Now throw Firefox Sync into the mix. Now all your encrypted passwords are in the cloud and available on any machine running Firefox. I found this to be really handy, but it represents its own risks. This is also just limited to Firefox, what about mobile browsers? What about Chrome or your friends computer?<br />Again, not a perfect solution, but not too bad either.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #4: Personal vault</b><br /><br />Some really paranoid people will say &#8220;But what if Mozilla aren&#8217;t encrypting your passwords properly?&#8221;, or &#8220;I don&#8217;t trust other people to store my passwords regardless of encryption&#8221;. Well, in that case, if you want to store all your random passwords, and ensure they are encrypted, you could always do it yourself.<br />I played with a nifty command line tool called &#8221;<a href="https://github.com/janlelis/pws" target="_blank">PWS</a>&#8221; and its open source so you can see exactly how they secure your passwords. The beauty about this method is that you are in complete control. For example, I could use a central repo to store my encrypted passwords and keep this synchronised across all machines, and if I don&#8217;t want to check out the repo (say, on a friends computer), I could just SSH to my VPS where I could get the password. It doesn&#8217;t fill forms in browsers, but it will copy the password to the clipboard for 10 seconds so you can just paste it in the browser (which is vulnerable to clipboard monitoring software/viruses).<br />It even has a random password generator for new sites. <br />While this method is great for paranoid people, its lacking a lot of features I would expect.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #5: Hosted password services</b><br /><br />If you were to combine the best parts of the previous methods, you would get a hosted service that provides browser plugins for form filling on any browser, is centralised and synchronised across all machines, is encrypted with a master password, has an easy way to pull out any existing passwords from a &#8220;vault&#8221; and makes it simple to sign up for new sites with a unique random password.<br />As it turns out there are quite a few of these services available, such as 1Password and LastPass.<br /><br /></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" target="_blank">1Password</a> is quite popular, especially among Mac users and provides clients for Mac, Windows, iPhones, Androids, etc. The interface is quite polished (as you could have guessed) but it costs about $50 for a Mac licence (or $70 if you want to use it on Windows and Mac). One feature that a lot people like is that you can choose where you would like to store the passwords, for example using dropbox to synchronise across machines, but personally I don&#8217;t think that provides any real advantage.</div><div></div><div></div><div><a href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a> is very similar in terms of features, but they host your encrypted passwords for you and it is free! They have plugins and clients for almost every conceivable device, but the only catch is that if you want to use the mobile browser plugins, you need a premium account, which costs $12 per year.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been using LastPass for a little while now and one thing I like the configurable random password generator. You can choose just how complex the generated passwords are by configuring length and character set. When you sign up for a new site, you can generate a ramdom password with one click and it will get entered into the site&#8217;s form and saved in your vault for future. It can fill in standard forms with your personal details (name, email address, etc.) It is accessible anyway by logging into the web interface and its all secured using a master password, which I recommend using a super strong passphrase for, something in the order of 20-30 characters would be good. Remember if someone can log in here, they can get everything!<br /><br />Another layer of protection is using 2 factor authentication. They have a few varieties for this, but the one I like is the Google Authenticator method. Basically when ever a new device is used to attempt to log in with your account, either using a plugin, app or just the website, they will need to provide the email address, the password and a token. To get this token I configured the Google Authenticator app on my Android, which means that even if someone was to somehow get my super strong master password, they would also need my phone before they can do anything.<br />I use this approach on my Gmail account too, but Gmail&#8217;s 2 factor authentication uses SMS&#8217;s instead of the Google Authenticator app.<br /><br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />So far I am pretty happy with LastPass. I now type in my super strong master password once a day and the rest is filled automatically. Signing up to new sites is a breeze and uses a completely random and unique password per site. My passwords are available in Firefox and Chrome; in Linux, Mac or Windows and potentially for my mobile browsers too (if I decide to pay $1 per month). Not only is my master password really strong, but it is backed up with 2 factor authentication using my phone. I can even get to my passwords from a public computer via the web interface and my phone (without needing to go via dropbox or anything). Best of all, I get all this security and convenience with minimal effort and without paying a cent!</div>
