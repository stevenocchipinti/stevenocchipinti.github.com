<div><p>Today marks 1 year since my first blog post.<br>In that time I have written 40 posts and this site has received over 7000 views from all over the world!<br>I&#8217;ve had some great feedback (even from total strangers), which has been fantastic - It&#8217;s a good feeling to know that my ramblings can actually be useful for others too.</p><p>I started this blog because as a fairly technical person, I am constantly learning, but one of the caveats of this constant learning culture is that some people (such as myself) find it quite hard to remember all the cool stuff we pick up over the years, so this blog&#8217;s primary purpose was to act as a &#8221;<i>memory supplement</i>&#8221;.</p><p>The idea being that when you read something new, it will only stay in your head if you keep using it (or, unlike me, if you have a really good memory), but sometimes what ever it is that we just learned won&#8217;t be totally relevant or useful until much later. </p><p>One of the best ways that I have found to retain this knowledge is to use it! For example, if you are reading up on a new programming language, use it! Write little scripts, re-write other existing programs in this new language and just get used to using it regularly.<br>If this isn&#8217;t available (or suitable) I find talking about it with other like-minded people will reinforce the knowledge too. Alot of the time, you can really reinforce your knowledge of a topic by teaching it to someone else. Meetups and groups of like minded friends are great for this. </p><p>This is part of the reason I started this blog. Once I learn something new (that I have a desire to remember) I try to write up a quick blog post as soon as I can.<br>Not only does this reinforce my knowledge, but if I do happen to forget, instead of using Google to re-learn it, I can simply use my blog&#8217;s search to find my own post on the topic and has the convenience of being written in my own way of thinking/writing.<br>Even if my post is out-of-date, or not complete enough, it will still refresh my memory and give me a better foundation to start learning up on that particular topic once again. </p><p>This blog has served its purpose well and will continue to do so. If you have a similar way of thinking (or a similar memory) as me, I highly recommend starting a blog! </p><p>Thanks to everyone that has been reading so far! :-) </p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back when I started uni, I bought a new <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2886">Asus A6J laptop</a>. It was one of the first laptops available with a dual core CPU (Core Duo, not Core 2 Duo) and decently powerful graphics (ATI X1600).<br/>
The A6J  is very dated now and weighing in at 2.85kg, its not very portable by today&rsquo;s standard (considering my <a href="/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html">Toshiba Portege</a> weighs just 1.13kg).<br/>
A couple of years after I bought it, I got sick of carrying it around, so I bought an Asus EeePc as a replacement for uni, so the A6J stayed at home and was rarely used &ndash; it was just a spare for a long time.</p>

<p>Up until recently, I was using I used it as a (stationary) desktop replacement at work but I now have a new job where I am provided a  Macbook Pro so this old machine is now spare once again. This with the recent release of <a href="http://xbmc.org/natethomas/2012/03/24/xbmc-11-0-eden/">XBMC 11 Eden</a>, I thought I may as well re-purpose it as a permanent HTPC.</p>

<p>I considered quite a few options, such as running Arch Linux, OpenElec or Ubuntu with XBMC installed, or going with the recently improved XBMCbuntu (formerly known as XBMC Live).</p>

<h2>XBMCbuntu</h2>

<p>I downloaded the iso and had a bit of a play. I love how it boots directly into XBMC without the need to startup Unity or anything like that, although it does let you exit to the login screen and select either &ldquo;XBMCbuntu&rdquo; (LXDE) or &ldquo;OpenBox&rdquo; which is nice.</p>

<p>Once it had booted, it behaved so slow! I figured it mustn&rsquo;t have the correct drivers installed, so I tried to use the restricted drivers from the repo and after hitting quite a few problems I consulted the AMD site.<br/>
The <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Legacy/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;amp;product=2.4.1.3.12&amp;amp;lang=English">AMD site explains</a> that my ATI X1600 is now &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; and is supported by the ATI Catalyst 9.3 proprietary linux driver.<br/>
So I downloaded that and yet again hit a bunch of other issues.</p>

<p>I spent a fair portion of the day battling with this and couldn&rsquo;t help but think back to how easy Ubuntu Desktop handled all this, so I thought I&rsquo;d just give that another go.</p>

<h2>Ubuntu Desktop + XBMC</h2>

<p>I downloaded the Ubuntu 11.10 iso and installed that over the top of XBMCbuntu and configured the user account as &lsquo;xbmc&rsquo; and to automatically login at startup.<br/>
I then followed the <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Installing_XBMC_for_Linux">instructions to install XBMC from their PPA</a>. I did a quick update, installed SSH, reconfigured grub to auto-boot in 1 second (instead of 10) and rebooted the machine.</p>

<p>When I launched XBMC, it was perfect! It was very snappy and there was no lag whatsoever.<br/>
I noticed that the power menu was missing the shutdown options that were in XBMCbuntu and that the suspend option did not work.<br/>
After a bit if research, I found a <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Suspend_and_wake_in_Ubuntu">wiki page</a> that explains how to modify <code>policykit</code> to allow xbmc access to all the power functions.<br/>
With this change, shutdown, suspend and hibernate were all working great.</p>

<p>I had already configured Wake-On-Lan in the past, so all that I needed to do was setup the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xbmc.android.remote&amp;amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy54Ym1jLmFuZHJvaWQucmVtb3RlIl0.">Android XBMC remote app</a> on my phone. After configuring the app with the laptops IP address, MAC address, etc. I was now able to use the &ldquo;Turn your XBMC&rsquo;s Power On&rdquo; button from the mobile app to fire up the laptop.<br/>
Of course to actually allow control of XBMC I needed to go into the settings screen and enable control via HTTP, etc.</p>

<p>So now I can power up the laptop and shut it down from my phone, but when it boots, I am brought into a Unity environment. In the past I would add XBMC to the startup applications, but with XBMC Eden, there is a better way.<br/>
XBMC Eden adds it self to the choice of desktop environments from the login screen (in other words, you get a choice: Unity or straight into XBMC like the live cd).<br/>
Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t remember the last choice with XBMC, so if I boot straight into it and then shut it down, next time it will still automatically boot in to Unity.</p>

<p>I then came across an <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoLogin#For_Ubuntu_10.04_.28Lucid_Lynx.29">Ubuntu community page</a> that pointed in the direction the the LightDM config file. (LightDM is the thing that manages the login screen).<br/>
I opened <code>/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</code> and saw this line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>user-session=ubuntu</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I replaced the <code>ubuntu</code> part of this line with <code>XBMC</code>, rebooted and low and behold, it booted straight into XBMC!</p>

<p>I now have a fully functional HTPC that I can completely control from my phone.<br/>
The only things left to do now are configure my media sources, install some plugins and maybe play with some new skins.</p>

At the end of last year my <i>HTC Desire HD</i> got its firmware upgrade to the new version of <i>HTC Sense</i> - the same version that the <i>HTC Sensation</i> is running.<br />At the time I thought it was quite cool, having shortcuts on the lock screen is great and the new eye candy looks pretty nice too.<br /><br />But there were some very unwelcome changes with this new version too&#8230; lag and poor battery life!<br />I generally keep my phone on charge at work, so I didn&#8217;t think this would bother me, but it got so bad that if I went out after work, by the time I got home it was flat (from 6pm to later that night). Even swiping between home screens would lag! So I figured it was time for a new phone, but in the meantime I thought I may as well experiment with rooting and other OS&#8217;s.<br /><br />To root the Desire HD is quite simple. The first thing to do is go get the &#8221;<i><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1259821" target="_blank"><u>Advanced Ace Hack Kit</u></a></i>&#8221; from the XDA Forums. In the zip file is all the tools you need to run the hack and most importantly, the aptly named &#8221;<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">effen-manual.html</span>&#8221;, which is <i>very</i> important!<br /><br />The manual explains everything you need to know, but the first step is checking that the version of android that you are running can be exploited.<br />I had software  version <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">3.12.405.1</span>, which judging by the <i>effen manual</i>, the hack tool can automatically downgrade to version <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">2.50.405.2</span> where there exists a flaw that can be exploited to give you root access.<br />Keep in mind that doing this will wipe your phone, so backup <i>everything</i>.<br /><br />The <i>effen manual</i> also explains how to setup your computer to enable the hack tool to work properly. There are very few steps for linux which was great!<br /><br />If you follow the instructions correctly, you will then have a stock standard install of an older version of HTC Sense. There are some advantages to having root access such as apps like titanium backup, ad blockers, etc. but the real fun comes from installing new Android ROMs.<br /><br />I looked at 2 third party ROMs, the first was <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/" target="_blank">Cyanogen Mod</a> and the second was <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=840040" target="_blank">Android Revolution</a>.<br /><br />Android Revolution looks pretty good. Visually it looks and behaves just like HTC Sense but they have made lots of improvements under the hood which in turn increases performance and battery life. As good as this looked, I haven&#8217;t actually tried this option yet. Instead, I opted to go for a bigger change of scenery and give Cyanogen Mod a go.<br /><br /><br />Cyanogen Mod does not look like HTC Sense at all. Instead it is based on stock standard Android 2.3. They have then implemented a slew of changes that come as default, such as an audio equaliser, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.adw.launcher&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">ADWLauncher</a>, the super-user app, a completely customisable button widget in the notification bar, customizable lock screens and a pretty cool torch app that lets you over charge the LEDs for super brightness!<br />This mod also lets you overclock the hardware, put limiters in place and lots of other options I was not used to seeing in the HTC Sense ROM.<br /><br />The 2 most important advantages of this change are that the UI is now quick and responsive again, I now have complete control over which effects are used and things like how long the animations should last, etc. and I have the best battery life I&#8217;ve ever had with this phone - I can now use the phone pretty heavily all day without needing a charge until I go to bed!<br /><br />Very happy with it now and it should keep me tied over until the Samsung Galaxy SIII is released :)

For quite a long time I used to use Yahoo! Mail.<br />Even though I was lucky enough to get an invite for Gmail in its early stages, Yahoo! Mail had (IMO) one killer feature: <i>Address Guard</i><br /><br />The idea behind <i>Address Guard</i> was simple, you make your primary email address, say <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">john.smith@yahoo.com</span>, and then a secondary <i>&#8220;base name&#8221;</i>, such as <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">johno007</span>.<br />This <i>base name</i> was not just another email address, infact all mail sent to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">johno007@yahoo.com</span> would get dropped.<br />Instead, use that base name to create an unlimited number of <i>&#8220;disposable addresses&#8221;</i>, such as <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">johno007-facebook@yahoo.com</span>, etc.<br /><br />The idea was that if you follow the simple 3 click process (settings -&gt; addressGaurd -&gt; add new address!) to create a new disposable email address every time you signed up for a new website, if ever they spammed you, you simply delete that address and they wont be able to bother you any more - brilliant!<br /><br />I avoided Gmail because they didn&#8217;t have the same <i>&#8220;whitelist&#8221;</i> approach to email addresses, but when I bought my domain name and started using Google Apps for email, I decided to use Gmail as my primary email provider.<br />Naturally this forced me to look for a similar way to defend again spam (albeit Gmails spam filtering is quite good).<br /><br />Google Apps provides <i>&#8220;nicknames&#8221;</i>, which works in much the same way, you can have an unlimited number of aliases for an account, except the process was a bit longer (settings -&gt; manage domain -&gt; users -&gt; Your user -&gt; Add a nickname) and I got too lazy for that after a little while.<br />I still use nicknames for certain things, but not for every website I sign up for.<br /><br />That&#8217;s when I discovered the + symbol in Gmail. Unlike Yahoo! Mail that uses the <i>&#8220;whitelist&#8221;</i> approach (only addresses you created will accept mail), you can use Gmail with a <i>&#8220;blacklist&#8221;</i> approach (all addresses accept mail unless you block them).<br /><br />Assume your email address is <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">john.smith@gmail.com</span>, you can append a + and then any (valid) characters you like to the end, such as <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">john.smith+facebook@gmail.com</span> and it will still get delivered.<br /><br />If some rogue website starts sending spam to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">john.smith+dodgysite@gmail.com</span>, then you can go into the Gmail settings and setup a filter to delete all mail that is sent to: <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">john.smith+dodgysite@gmail.com</span>.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s quite as nice as <i>Address Guard</i>, but it is a bit more convenient because there is no set up. The biggest downside is that quite a few websites consider an email address to be invalid if it has a + symbol in it, but most are fine.

  <div class="entry-content"><div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
On my Android phone, I use an app called &#8221;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=mobi.beyondpod&amp;hl=en%20" target="_blank">BeyondPod</a>&#8221;. <br /><br />BeyondPod is great because unlike <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.reader&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLnJlYWRlciJd" target="_blank">Google Reader</a> and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.alphonso.pulse&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5hbHBob25zby5wdWxzZSJd" target="_blank">Pulse</a> (which are other great RSS readers), BeyondPod will download video and audio podcasts on a schedule.<br /><br />What this means for me, is that at 2:30 AM, my phone will use my home ADSL2&#8217;s off-peak downloads and fetch a bunch of regular podcasts so when I wake up and make my way into work, I will have all the latest episodes of my favourite shows to watch and listen to on the train.<br /><br />One of the feeds that I&#8217;m subscribed to is <a href="http://xkcd.com/%20" target="_blank">XKCD</a>. If you look at the comics online, you probably already know that if hover your mouse over the image, you get to see an extra message about the comic.<br /><br />On Google Reader, you can tap and hold the image and use the menu to get to the tooltip, but with BeyondPod, there is no such option.<br /><br />This means that the tooltip is actually included in the <a href="http://xkcd.com/atom.xml" target="_blank">feed</a>, so I thought it would be pretty easy to write a little proxy that pulls out the &#8220;title=&#8221; attribute and appends it to the body.<br /><br />Before I started coding, I thought that surely someone would have already done this, so after a quick Google search I came across a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=upJ5TUni3BGUZU9yLO2fWQ" target="_blank">Yahoo! Pipe</a> from &#8221;<a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/person.info?guid=D4HQ7VIJ2YNE6NZRH3VHJOBREA">Benjamin Cook</a>&#8221; that does exactly that.<br /><br />Ben&#8217;s Pipe appends a &#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&#8221; and then the tooltip, but the &#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&#8221; seems to be getting escaped, so I copied the pipe and removed the &#8220;&lt;br /&gt;&#8221; and the end result was exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />If you have a similar problem, you can add <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=61e54ab0572541bd03cd44f3e601482e" target="_blank">my version of the pipe</a> to your reader and here&#8217;s what it&#8217;ll look like: <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lErLdyOZLO8/T0XMYWJY6SI/AAAAAAAAADw/-yKGNhQwHgw/s1600/2012-02-23_16-14-04.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lErLdyOZLO8/T0XMYWJY6SI/AAAAAAAAADw/-yKGNhQwHgw/s320/2012-02-23_16-14-04.jpg" width="192" /></a></div><br />

As mentioned in a <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2011/09/code-review-workflow-with-github.html" target="_blank">previous post</a>, we use <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html" target="_blank">GitHub-Flow</a> at work and I really like it.<br />In essence, it involves doing work in feature branches, while maintaining an <i>always deployable</i> <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">master</span> branch, then opening a pull request to merge a new feature / bugfix into <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">master</span>, which provides a great mechanism for code review / sign-off.<br /><br />So a fairly typical situation would be as follows:<br /><ul><li>Bug found in app</li><li>Create an issue on GitHub with description, assignee, etc.</li><li>Create a new branch off master for the fix</li><li>Code it up, test locally, etc.</li><li>Push branch to GitHub </li><li>Open pull request to merge back into master</li><li>Get review / sign-off inside of the pull request</li><li>Deploy </li></ul>When a pull request is opened on GitHub, it automatically creates an issue for that pull request, which would normally be helpful, but we already created an issue when the bug was discovered.<br />So now we have 2 issues and 1 pull request. What&#8217;s nice is that if I push more commits to that branch, it will appear in the pull request automatically, but not the initial issue.<br /><br />After looking into this, it seems (AFAIK) GitHub do not provide a way of attaching a pull request to an existing issue via the site, but they do provide that functionality via their API.<br /><br />That is when I discovered <a href="http://defunkt.io/hub/" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Hub</span></a>.<br /><a href="https://github.com/defunkt/hub" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Hub</span></a> is a wrapper for <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git</span> and while it adds more power to alot of the standard git commands, hub adds one command that is really useful for me:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">git pull-request -i 49</blockquote><br />This basically means<i> &#8220;Open a pull request to merge the current branch into master and attach the pull request to issue 49&#8221;</i>.<br /><br />This means that the initial bug description, the commits, the review conversation and the merge are all encapsulated in a single issue - fantastic!<br />I don&#8217;t know why this isn&#8217;t built in to the web interface (or maybe it is and I just don&#8217;t know how).

Have you ever SSH&#8217;ed to a server and found you need to copy some data back where a simple selection copy and paste just doesn&#8217;t seem practical?<br />When this happens to me, I normally dump that data to a temp file, start up another terminal and SCP the file back before going back to delete the temp file, but I recently found a better way.<br /><br />I discovered <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">xclip</span>. Using the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">-X</span> option of SSH to enable X11 forwarding, <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">xclip</span> allows you to interact with the <i>&#8220;X selections&#8221;</i> clipboard.<br /><br />To use it, log on to a remote server via <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ssh -X</span> and ensure <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">xclip</span> is installed, then simply pipe data to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">xclip</span> and you will be able to paste it anywhere locally with the usual X selection paste (mouse wheel click, shift-insert, etc.).<br /><br />Here is an example:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ssh -X steve@example.com<br />sudo apt-get install xclip<br />ps -ef | xclip</blockquote><br />Now anywhere on your local linux machine, you can press &lt;shift&gt;-&lt;insert&gt; (or mouse wheel click) to paste the content.<br />If you need to pipe this data to another process locally, you can retrieve the clipboard from the command like with <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">xclip</span> like this:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">xclip -o | less</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally decided to install Minecraft on my new shiny <a href="/2011/12/toshiba-portege-z830.html">Toshiba Portege z830</a>.<br/>
Ubuntu ships with an open-source version of Java, which did run Minecraft, but the graphics were terrible, even on the lowest settings. There were artefacts everywhere!</p>

<p>So as recommended, I switched to the official JRE. Now the login screen works, but that&rsquo;s about it. After logging in, I just got a black screen and the following exception in the console:</p>

<p>After discussing the problem in IRC, the solution was quite simple. It turns out <code>lwjgl</code> is a &ldquo;<em>Light Weight Java Game Library</em>&rdquo; and the version I had wasn&rsquo;t behaving.<br/>
On the advice of the helpful IRC&#8217;ers, I downloaded the latest <code>lwjgl</code> from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/">here</a> (which at time of writing is 2.8.3) to get it all to work nicely.</p>

<p>To install it, I downloaded the zip file, extracted it to a temporary directory, then copied across these files:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cp lwjgl-2.8.3/jar/lwjgl.jar ~/.minecraft/bin
</span><span class='line'>cp lwjgl-2.8.3/native/linux/* ~/.minecraft/bin/natives</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Done! Now it works nicely.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you saw my <a href="/2011/11/13-core-i7-samsung-series-9-ultrabook.html">last post</a>, you would have seen that I recently bought a 13&#8221; Samsung Series 9 ultrabook &ndash; I still think these machines are stunning!</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>There are a couple of little complaints floating around about the Samsung, like heat output, easily finger-printed chasis, but none of these <em>really</em> bother me, but there is one thing that does&hellip; alot&hellip; and its the wifi!</p>

<p>I could be using the laptop in the next room from my wireless router and it would dropout completely or go incredibly slow, if I move to the other side of the house where my bedroom is, my phone will have full reception, but this laptop will not see the wifi network at all &ndash; and this in unacceptable.</p>

<h2>The transition</h2>

<p>After returning the laptop (twice) I eventually asked for my money back so I could go purchase my second preference &ndash; the Macbook Air.<br/>
Unfortunately, the shop would not give me a full refund and could only offer me a credit note.<br/>
I tried to explain that no other units in store could offer me the same specs that I was after, the Samsung&rsquo;s best competition is the Macbook Air, but as they couldn&rsquo;t help me I asked to see what else they have in a light 13&#8221;.</p>

<p>The sales guy showed me an <a href="http://zenbook.asus.com/">Asus Zenbook</a> and a new product which had just arrived to their store, the <a href="http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/portege/z830/">Toshiba Portege Z830</a>.<br/>
I was lucky enough to be the first to see this at their store and even got to open the display model and check it out.</p>

<p>The decision between the two was tough!<br/>
The Asus Zenbook had a very sturdy exterior and had a similar tapered  design to the Macbook Air while the Toshiba Portege had a business feel  to it, but was slightly lighter and thinner. <br/>
They were both similarly spec&#8217;ed with Core i5&rsquo;s, 128GB SSD&rsquo;s and 4GB of RAM, but there were a few notable differences between them.</p>

<p>Although the Asus Zenbook does not have a backlit keyboard and has reduced size ports, it does has a higher resolution screen than the Samsung and Toshiba, but like the Mac it&rsquo;s a glossy screen. I personally prefer matte screens because even in brightly lit areas or even outside in direct sunlight, the screen is alot more visible.</p>

<p>The Toshiba Portege has a matte screen, backlit keyboard, has a full size HDMI port, VGA port, Ethernet port, 2x USB 2.0 ports, 1x USB 3.0 port and SD card reader and its thinner and lighter. Toshiba also give a 3 year warranty out-of-the-box with this model.<br/>
The screen is quite a bit more flimsy than the others and the system fan does tend to groan a little (compared to the Samsung at least), but this is probably all I can complain about.</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>I took a day to think about it and eventually made up my mind for the Portege.<br/>
In the US, there is an i7 variety with 6GB of RAM, but I don&rsquo;t really want to wait for it to get here.<br/>
I took a look at a <a href="http://ark.intel.com/compare/54616,56858">comparison</a> between the i7 from the Samsung and the i5 from the Toshiba, and while I would have paid the extra for the i7, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll really notice the difference in most scenarios.</p>

<p>It seems I am not the only one who ended up swapping a Samsung Series 9 for a Toshiba Portege Z830 either, I came across this <a href="http://thessdreview.com/our-reviews/sata-3/toshiba-z830-13-3-ultrabook-laptop-review-toshiba-creates-one-amazing-ultrabook/">blog post</a> where the author goes into more detail and provides results of quite specific tests.</p>

<p>In the end I paid $1539 for the laptop with a 3 year warranty and then an extra $79 to upgrade it to 6GB of RAM.<br/>
While it&rsquo;s no Samsung Series 9, its pretty nice and the cut in performance saved me a little more than $600.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Back in my first year of uni, I bought one of the early Core Duo (not Core 2 Duo) 15&#8221; Asus laptops which at the time was great and it had a decent graphics card for games, etc.<br/>
Roughly 6 years later, its showing its age. The battery lasts less than an hour now, it weighs about 3kg not including the adapter and performance is lacking compared to todays technology.</p>

<p>After a recent shoulder injury and a busy week that involved me carrying my laptop from place to place, I decided it was time to reward myself with an early Christmas present and buy a new machine.</p>

<p>My requirements were:</p>

<ul>
<li>13&#8221; screen</li>
<li>As thin and as light as possible to aid portability</li>
<li>Powerful enough to do almost anything my daily activities could involve</li>
<li>&lt;~ $2000</li>
</ul>


<p>I compared as many of these 13&#8221; <em>&ldquo;ultrabooks&rdquo;</em> as I could and before long I had created a shortlist of my top 3 &ndash; which included an Asus u-Series, a Macbook Air and a Samsung Series 9.</p>

<h2>Asus u-Series</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.asus.com.au/Notebooks/Superior_Mobility/U36SD/#specifications">Asus machines</a>, as usual, had a very good bang-for-buck, a nice thickness of 19mm and unlike most others, some models had full size video output and ethernet plugs.<br/>
While the price and size were right, the highest spec&#8217;ed machines were not quite as impressive as its competition. If budget was the number one concern, the Asus u-Series and Zenbook range offer pretty good value.</p>

<h2>Macbook Air</h2>

<p>I have never been a <em>&ldquo;Mac person&rdquo;</em> due to the traditional heavy pricing and proprietary nature of alot of their products, but these days (after some convincing) I believe the hardware and even price does have a surprisingly strong position in the competition.<br/>
The <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_pro">13&#8221; Macbook Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/macbookair/specs.html">Macbook Air</a> both had very good specs to offer for around the $2000 price tag, both with Core i7&rsquo;s, 4-8GB RAM and SSD&rsquo;s, not to mention pretty attractive packaging.<br/>
After seeing a Macbook Air up close, I really liked how the thickest point is about 17mm or so at the back but it tapers off to next to nothing at the front.</p>

<p>So the model I chose for comparison purposes was worth $1928.99 and had the following specs:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.8GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7</li>
<li>4GB 1333MHz DDR3 SDRAM</li>
<li>256GB flash storage</li>
<li>Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter ($30)</li>
</ul>


<p>I don&rsquo;t like the very proprietary DisplayPort and its $30 adapters, but its not too bad as almost <em>everyone</em> at my office uses a Mac so finding a spare adapter when needed wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard (I guess popularity offsets proprietary-ness).</p>

<p>The operating system did not bother me too much either as I intended to be running Linux as my primary OS anyway, but having a Mac would give me more familiarity with OSX which would be helpful considering its popularity in my line of work.</p>

<p>The minor annoyances would be: expensive adapters for video and ethernet ports, unfamiliar keyboard layout (command key where alt should be, etc), non-upgradeable ram, glossy screen, etc. &ndash; but those are pretty minor.</p>

<h2>Samsung Series 9</h2>

<p>I found these ultrabooks to have a very unique look and one of the first well thought out, thin designs that are not just another Mac look-a-like.<br/>
The sales pitch always includes a spiel about its &ldquo;Duralumin&rdquo;&ndash; which is a light and strong material used in aircrafts and while it looks stunning and adds sophistication and uniqueness to the overall design on the unit, this material along with the black plastic are both fingerprint magnets!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/pc-peripherals/notebook-pc/thin-light/NP900X3A-A03AU/index.idx?pagetype=prd_detail&amp;amp;tab=specification">specs of the Series 9 unit</a> I used for comparison (and ultimately bought) was quite good:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.5GHz Core i7</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
<li>256GB SSD</li>
<li>Micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter ($15)</li>
</ul>


<p>Initially I thought 1.5 GHz was kinda low, but after conversations with quite a few people and some <a href="http://ark.intel.com/compare/54616">research</a>, this speed is its sort-of <em>&ldquo;resting&rdquo;</em> frequency and will automatically scale up to 2.6GHz when required.</p>

<p>The one big catch with this system is the RRP of ~$2700, while most Aussie shops sold them for ~$2500. This made me consider the Mac even more!</p>

<p>But during my research I saw <a href="https://www.mln.com.au/">MLN</a>&rsquo;s price drop down to a much more attractive $1997 and immediately rang them to find out more details and how long the special would last. It turns out that Samsung are starting to phase them out of stores (presumably to make way for a new product next year) and naturally they had sold alot of units and only had a few left.</p>

<p>I did a bit more research and found that to save space, the ports are hidden behind very aircraft-like flaps, but as with the Mac, they are reduced size ports.<br/>
The video output is provided in the form of a micro-HDMI port &ndash; which is at least a more common format and I don&rsquo;t need to go through apple.com.<br/>
The other space-saving trade-off was a (sadly) proprietary ethernet port that comes bundled with an adapter to convert it to RJ45 &ndash; but unlike the Mac where you need to buy a USB network adapter, this actually has the network card built in, it just has an unusual plug &ndash; which I don&rsquo;t intend to use much anyway.</p>

<p>Another plus is this model comes with 1x USB 3.0 port (and a 2.0 port) which is great considering the speeds my brother gets with his USB 3.0 flash drive.</p>

<p>So I went to MLN and inspected the unit up close and what eventually made my decision for the Samsung was that for about the same price I get a machine with double the RAM (handy for VMs), a windows licence for portable gaming and a bunch of freebies from MLN including the HDMI to micro-HDMI cable, a set of Sennheiser headphones and a padded sleeve to carry it.</p>

<p>I was able to get the cable and sleeve free because I opted to purchase the extended 3 year pickup warranty for an additional $180ish and the headphones were a Christmas present :)</p>

<p>Initial impressions are very positive, the screen is incredibly bright and vibrant and with a smooth matte finish, I have had no issues using it outdoors.<br/>
The backlit keyboard is quite nice too, although the brightness of this light is controlled via windows drivers, so in linux (at this stage) I cant control its brightness.<br/>
The touchpad is large and seems to employ the same technique as the Mac Magic Mouse where there is one click-able button (the lower part of the pad) and depending on where your finger is when you click determines a right or left mouse click and once again, this doesnt work in Linux out of the box, but the standard 2 finger tap works as per normal.<br/>
Using Ubuntu 11.10 the rest of the hardware works out of the box, so no need to fiddle with drivers for network, graphics, webcam, etc.</p>

<p>Overall I am very happy with my purchase and its a huge step up from my old 15.4&#8221; 3kg laptop!</p>
