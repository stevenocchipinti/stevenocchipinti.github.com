    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d love to learn Street Fighter 2, but there are just so many combos! <br/>
&ndash; <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/the-vim-learning-curve-is-a-myth">The Vim Learning Curve is a Myth</a>, Thoughtbot</p></blockquote>

<p>A lot of people are scared of learning of vim because of the initial learning curve.</p>

<p>When learning vim for the first time there are lots of approaches, but two common ways are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn &ldquo;pure&rdquo; vi/vim, then introduce vimrc options and then plugins</li>
<li>Start with an existing &ldquo;customization&rdquo; (from someone else), then learn what things do</li>
</ol>


<p>Once upon a time, I would have suggested learning the basic features of vim before getting into customization, but there are quite a lot of people who are not interested in learning the tool unless they can be productive straight away.<br/>
When coming from an IDE, the apparent shortcomings of a less integrated text editor will scare them away before they have discovered the power of editing text with vim.</p>

<p>This guide is aimed at those people. I want to outline some steps to learn vim that makes the transition from IDE to vim as easy as possible with the hope of making vim a less scary step.</p>

<h2>Installing Vim</h2>

<p>Most systems will come with a version of vim, but you may want to get the latest version from the systems package manager for a more complete feature set.</p>

<p>On a mac, the standard install of <code>vim</code> is missing clipboard support so I would recommend installing MacVim, here is how I do it with homebrew:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew install macvim
</span><span class='line'>brew linkapps</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This package provides <code>mvim</code> on the command line, but <code>vim</code> will still refer to the system version, so I setup a couple of aliases in my <code>.bash_profile</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>alias vim="mvim -v"
</span><span class='line'>alias vi="vim"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

<p>This guide is more about setting up vim in a manner that won&rsquo;t seem too crippling when coming from an IDE, so I won&rsquo;t focus too much on editing effectively with vim here.</p>

<p>If vim is completely new to you and you don&rsquo;t know the basics such as the difference between <em>command mode</em> and <em>insert mode</em> or how to quit vim, I would recommend pausing the guide here and running <code>vimtutor</code> in your terminal to learn the basics.</p>

<h2>Configuring Vim</h2>

<p>Vim uses a <code>.vimrc</code> configuration file in your home directory. There is a plethora of configuration options you can put here, but I thought I would offer some basic options to get you started.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/dotvim/blob/master/vimrc"><code>.vimrc</code></a> is quite large, but here is a snippet for some basic options that you can put into your own <code>.vimrc</code> to get started:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>

<span class='line-number'>22</span>
<span class='line-number'>23</span>
<span class='line-number'>24</span>
<span class='line-number'>25</span>
<span class='line-number'>26</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>filetype plugin indent on
</span><span class='line'>syntax on

</span><span class='line'>set expandtab         " Use spaces instead of tab characters
</span><span class='line'>set wrap              " Wrap the display lines (not actual text)

</span><span class='line'>map &lt;leader&gt;p "+p
</span><span class='line'>map &lt;leader&gt;y "+y</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Navigating code</h2>

<p>Vim has builtin support for <code>ctags</code>, which indexes your code and allows you to jump to the definition of a method or class. As usual, on a mac you will have a standard version of <code>ctags</code> installed, but it&rsquo;s not very good, so I recommend installing the <em>exuberant ctags</em> package from homebrew:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>brew install ctags
</span><span class='line'>sudo mv /usr/bin/ctags{,-bsd}
</span><span class='line'>sudo ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/ctags/5.8/bin/ctags /usr/bin/ctags</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To make use of ctags, in the root of a project run the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ctags -R .</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will need to be run when the code changes to keep the tags file up to date, so I have setup <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2011/08/08/effortless-ctags-with-git.html">git hooks</a> to automate this. If you don&rsquo;t want to setup git hooks, you can execute this command from within vim with <code>:!ctags -R .</code></p>

<p>Now if you open some code, move your cursor over an occurrence of a method or class, you can jump into the definition of that method or class with the following key bindings:</p>

<p><code>crtl</code> + <code>]</code> = Jump to definition (of what is under the cursor)<br/>
<code>crtl</code> + <code>T</code> = Jump back from following a tag</p>

<p>The following key bindings are also useful for navigation and do <em>not</em> require ctags:</p>

<p><code>/foo</code> = Search for <code>foo</code><br/>
<code>*</code> = Search for the word under the cursor<br/>
<code>n</code> = Jump to the next occurrence of the search<br/>
<code>N</code> = Jump to the previous occurrence of the search<br/>
<code>crtl</code> + <code>o</code> = Go back from the last jump<br/>
<code>crtl</code> + <code>i</code> = Go forward to the recent jump</p>

<h2>Vim Plugins</h2>

<p>Vim has a plugin system, but by default it does not do a good job of keeping plugins isolated from each other. To improve this, there are plugins that manage plugins.<br/>
I recommend using <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a>, here is how to set it up along with a few useful vim plugins:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
</span><span class='line'>git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then place the following at the top of your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>filetype off
</span><span class='line'>set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/vundle/
</span><span class='line'>call vundle#rc()
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'gmarik/vundle'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'kien/ctrlp.vim'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'tpope/vim-rails'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'tpope/vim-commentary'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'tpope/vim-repeat'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'tpope/vim-surround'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'tpope/vim-cucumber'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'bogado/file-line'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'godlygeek/tabular'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'ecomba/vim-ruby-refactoring'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'scrooloose/syntastic'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'tsaleh/vim-matchit'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'kchmck/vim-coffee-script'
</span><span class='line'>Bundle 'cakebaker/scss-syntax.vim'
</span><span class='line'>filetype plugin indent on</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then, I choose configure some of those plugins towards the bottom of the <code>.vimrc</code> like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>" NERDTREE PLUGIN - (mnemonic: Files)
</span><span class='line'>nmap &lt;leader&gt;f :NERDTreeToggle
</span><span class='line'>nmap &lt;leader&gt;F :NERDTreeFind
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>" AIRLINE PLUGIN
</span><span class='line'>let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
</span><span class='line'>let g:airline#extensions#tabline#show_buffers = 0
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>" CTRL-P PLUGIN
</span><span class='line'>let g:ctrlp_user_command = {
</span><span class='line'>\   'types': {
</span><span class='line'>\     1: ['.git/', 'cd %s && git ls-files'],
</span><span class='line'>\     2: ['.hg/', 'hg --cwd %s locate -I .'],
</span><span class='line'>\   },
</span><span class='line'>\   'fallback': 'find %s -type f'
</span><span class='line'>\ }</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, from within vim, run <code>:BundleInstall</code></p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>At this point, you should have a somewhat powerful installation of vim, the next step is to learn how to use this power. Below are some resources to help you learn how to use vim effectively.</p>

<ul>
<li>run <code>vimtutor</code> on the command line to learn</li>

    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2014/03/10/completely-removing-a-git-commit-due-to-sensitive-information</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently made a big mistake and checked in some sensitive information into a
public GitHub repository.</p>

<p>The first reaction is to remove that sensitive information. While that is a good
first step, making a new commit to remove the information means that when anyone
looks at the commit history, the sensitive information will still be visible.</p>

<h2>Re-writing history</h2>

<p>The next step is to re-write the git history.<br/>
This can be done a few ways, but I took a simple approach and sqaushed the
commits down such that the addition and removal of the sensitive information
cancel each other out and the new commit doesn&rsquo;t contain any sensitive
information.</p>

<p>To demonstrate, here is the history of a git respository where some sensitive
information was commited in <code>bbd80c4</code> and then removed in <code>a120437</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
<span class='line-number'>23</span>
<span class='line-number'>24</span>
<span class='line-number'>25</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$&gt; git log --oneline

</span><span class='line'> KEY=value
</span><span class='line'> MORE=data
</span><span class='line'>-PASSWORD=secret
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>From here, I used git&rsquo;s interactive rebase feature to modify the relevant
commits. In this case, I chose the commit just before the sensitive data was
added, like this: <code>git rebase -i 0115d7b</code></p>

<p>In the interactive editor, I did the following and then provided a new commit
message:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pick a120437 Ooops... remove sensitive data!
</span><span class='line'>squash bbd80c4 Add some more data</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This resulted in the last 2 commits being merged into a new one.<br/>
Here is the history:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'> KEY=value
</span><span class='line'>+MORE=data</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Rewriting commits that have already been pushed to a remote means a couple of
things.<br/>
For one, when you push this new history to the remote, you may require
the <code>--force</code> option to disregard the existing history.<br/>
Also, anyone who has an existing clone of the repository will have issues when
they pull down the latest changes but in the case of sensitive information, this
is a necessary side-effect.</p>

<h2>Cleaning up the cached commits</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;re not done yet!<br/>
Git keeps track of all changes made to a repository, even though the history
does not show the <em>bad</em> commits, they are still there! You can view all changes
to the repository using <code>git reflog</code>. From this command you can find the SHA of
the <em>bad</em> commit and then use <code>git show</code> to see the sensitive information.</p>

<p>This means that GitHub also still has the <em>bad</em> commits and if you know the SHA
you will be able to find that sensitive information again.
To fix this we should clear the local cache and GitHub&rsquo;s cache.</p>

<p>You can clear the your local reflog by issuing these commands:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rm -rf .git/refs/original/
</span><span class='line'>git reflog expire --expire=now --all
</span><span class='line'>git gc --prune=now
</span><span class='line'>git gc --aggressive --prune=now</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>GitHub doesn&rsquo;t give us a way to clear a repositorys cache, but due to the
nature of git, simply deleting the repository and pushing a new copy of your
local repository to GitHub will effectively destroy that cache.</p>

<p>GitHub also have an article on how to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data">remove sensitive data</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/12/14/preparing-for-trailwalker/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-14T22:49:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/12/14/preparing-for-trailwalker</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2011, I attempted <a href="trailwalker.oxfam.org.au">The Oxfam TrailWalker</a>.<br/>
I didn&rsquo;t finish the full 100km &ndash; due to injuries I had to stop at about 60km,
but it was quite an experience none the less.</p>

<p>Recently a friend asked me what I did to prepare for TrailWalker, so here is a
quick post to explain some key points that helped me.</p>

<h2>1. Do as much training as possible!</h2>

<p>Expect to spend many months of weekends leading up to the event for training.<br/>
Start small (short, flat walks. Yarra trail, etc.) and work your way up to the
harder ones (hill climbs, longer distances, etc.)<br/>
Try to go every weekend, the more you do, the more your body will become
conditioned for hiking.<br/>
Go rain, hail, shine, day, night, etc. It&rsquo;ll help you realize what you need
(food, water-proof shoes/pants, stronger torch, etc.).<br/>
Try to fit in at least one night hike and one long hike well before the event
to see how you cope.<br/>
You could pick a different segment of the actual track every weekend so you get
an idea of what the event will be like.</p>

<h2>2. Find your weak points</h2>

<p>My first training hike, I got blisters.<br/>
For me, I had to use better socks (didn&rsquo;t think it would actually help, but it
made a huge difference!).<br/>
I also spoke to professionals and learned how to strap my feet properly and
ensured my laces were done up tight enough.<br/>
All this with shoes that actually fit my feet properly meant I never got
blisters again.<br/>
I&rsquo;m glad too, in the medical tents, there were people with epic blisters!
&hellip;Scary stuff!</p>

<h2>3. Hydration</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading up on how to hydrate properly. My memory is a little
sketchy, but you have to pace yourself with water.<br/>
Too much and you flush your body of minerals, feel bloated, etc.<br/>
Not enough and you are more likely to suffer from exhaustion.<br/>
Sip instead of gulp.<br/>
You may want to supplement with electrolytes. This is also available in a
powder that you can mix into your water.</p>

<h2>4. Food</h2>

<p>Something worth reading up on too.<br/>
I found having frequent small meals with a mix of high-GI and low-GI
ingredients worked the best.<br/>
For example, a single snack would be a slice of multi-grain bread (low-GI) with
jam (high-GI), folded in half and individually wrapped.<br/>
This made it easy to pull one out of a bad on the go. Sugary muesli bars also
work pretty well.<br/>
Make sure you drink water whenever you eat too, it&rsquo;ll help with digestion and
keep you from feeling too hungry.</p>

<h2>5. Shoes</h2>

<p>Like I said earlier, get shoes that fit your feet properly &ndash; Movement and
rubbing will get pretty bad as you work towards 100km!<br/>
Don&rsquo;t buy new shoes just before they event, they need time to be broken in. If
you want to buy new shoes, allow at least 3 or 4 training hikes in them first
(preferably the smaller training hikes).</p>

<h2>6. Sleeping</h2>

<p>We decided against sleeping, we thought it would be harder to get going again
afterwards.<br/>
In hindsight I think a couple of powernaps would have helped a fair bit.<br/>
If you do decide to sleep, I would probably recommend getting your support crew
to bring blankets and also wake you up before you sleep for too long.</p>

<h2>7. Team dynamics</h2>

<p>Teams can get on each others nerves after spending so long with each other,
especially when your extremely exhausted.<br/>
Patience is key, but also sticking together is very important.<br/>
Sometimes, some team members will want to go faster than others, this can cause
issues and may result in the team splitting up during the event &ndash; this is not
ideal and should be avoided.<br/>
Make sure your team has the same goal for the event (i.e. &ldquo;just finishing&rdquo; or
&ldquo;getting a good time&rdquo;).<br/>
One strategy is to let the slowest in the team lead the way.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>TrailWalker was a great experience (other than the injuries I incurred).<br/>
You have to work quite hard (especially if you&rsquo;ve never done hiking before, like
myself) but it all adds to a fantastic sense of accomplishment at the end &ndash;
even if you don&rsquo;t finish.<br/>
I learned a lot by doing this and even though training every weekend was tiring,
it was actually a lot of fun.<br/>
It was definitely a step out of my comfort zone, but I would recommend others
to give it a go &ndash; and it&rsquo;s for a great cause!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/11/10/installing-minecraft-in-linux/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-10T12:26:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/11/10/installing-minecraft-in-linux</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>1. Download Oracle Java</h2>

<p>First you will need the official Oracle version of Java (the open source
alternatives will probably not work as well for Minecraft). I think you can
just download the runtime, but I personally opt for installing the complete
Java Development Kit (JDK).</p>

<p>You can download the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">official JDK here</a>.<br/>
If you run a RedHat based distro, there is a <code>.rpm</code>, otherwise just get the
<code>.tgz</code> for your system.</p>

<h2>2. Installing Oracle Java</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, the version of java is 7u45.<br/>
I move this <code>.tar.gz</code> file from my downloads folder to <code>/opt</code> and unzip it
there, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mv ~/Downloads/jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz /opt
</span><span class='line'>cd /opt
</span><span class='line'>tar xzvf jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create a new directory called <code>jdk1.7.0_45</code>.<br/>
As there is a good chance we will be updating java in the future, I create a
symlink that we can easily change to the new versions in the future like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ln -s jdk1.7.0_45 jdk</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now when ever you want to find java, it will be in <code>/opt/jdk</code>.</p>

<p>All we have to do now is make the executables available on the <code>PATH</code>.<br/>
Edit your <code>.bashrc</code> (or <code>.profile</code>, etc.) and add this line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/jdk/bin/</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>3. Install Minecraft</h2>

<p>Get Minecraft from the <a href="https://minecraft.net/download">official Minecraft download page</a>.
Under the &ldquo;Minecraft for Linux / Other&rdquo; there is a link to download the
official Minecraft <code>.jar</code> file.  I also put this in <code>/opt</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir /opt/minecraft
</span><span class='line'>mv ~/Downloads/Minecraft.jar /opt/minecraft</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>At this point we can start Minecraft with this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>java -jar Minecraft.jar</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>4. Setting up an Application Launcher for Gnome</h2>

<p>I use Gnome Shell and if I&rsquo;m not in a terminal, I normally use Gnome&rsquo;s
<em>Activities Overview</em> to launch apps by pressing the &lsquo;super&rsquo; key, typing
&ldquo;Minecraft&rdquo; and pressing &lsquo;enter&rsquo;.</p>

<p>We want Minecraft to be installed just like any other app, so we will need to
add a launcher for Minecraft, but before we do that, we need an icon for it.
I just found one online, so lets download it to our <code>/opt/minecraft</code> directory.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>cd /opt/minecraft
</span><span class='line'>wget http://images.wikia.com/yogbox/images/d/dd/Minecraft_Block.svg</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then to make an application launcher, you can use this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/.local/share/applications</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img class="center" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9VnJ9K_nqQo/Un72Np6LzPI/AAAAAAAABTg/PVig82azah8/w435-h224-no"></p>

<p>You can assign it the logo we downloaded earlier and use this for the command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>/opt/jdk/bin/java -jar /opt/minecraft/Minecraft.jar</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>5. Have fun!</h2>

<p>Now you can launch Minecraft just like the other apps in Gnome Shell!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/10/18/rake-task-with-an-arbitrary-number-of-arguments/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-18T14:10:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/10/18/rake-task-with-an-arbitrary-number-of-arguments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rake gives you a way of specifying arguments for a given task like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">desc</span> <span class="s2">&quot;A task that can accept a optional &#39;foo&#39; argument&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:thing</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:foo</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">task</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:foo</span><span class="o">]</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will make the value of <code>foo</code> available in the <code>args</code> variable.
When you run <code>rake -T</code>, it will show you that argument like this:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; rake -T
rake thing[foo]  # A task that can accept a optional 'foo' argument
</code></pre>

<p>But what if you want to allow an arbitrary number of arguments, like a list of
usernames to report on?</p>

<h2>A solution</h2>

<p>You could use an alternative method of passing arguments in, such as <code>ARGV</code> or
Environment Variables, but Rake does provide a way.
The <code>args</code> block parameter behaves like a hash, but it is actually a
<code>Rake::TaskArguments</code> object. This object responds to an <code>#extras</code> method that
will return an array of any extra arguments.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:thing</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:foo</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">task</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">|</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:foo</span><span class="o">]</span>     <span class="c1"># First argument</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">args</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">extras</span>    <span class="c1"># The rest of the arguments</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will allow you to call the task like this:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; rake thing[foo]
foo

$&gt; rake thing[foo,extra1,extra2]
foo
extra1
extra2
</code></pre>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>While you can specify many arguments on the command line, (unless they are
quoted) the arguments can not be separated by spaces, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; rake thing[foo,extra1]    # GOOD
foo
extra1
$&gt; rake thing[foo, extra1]   # BAD
Don't know how to build task 'thing[foo,'
</code></pre>

<p>This means you may want to include some explanation in the <code>desc</code> section.</p>

<p>Also, <code>rake -T</code> will not show the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; arguments, only the named arguments:</p>

<pre><code>$&gt; rake -T
rake thing[foo]  # A task that can accept a optional 'foo' argument
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In ruby, the <code>||=</code> operator will assign a given value to a variable, if that
variable does not already have a value.
For example:</p>

<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will assign <code>"bar"</code> to <code>foo</code>, unless <code>foo</code> is already set.
In other words, it will make <code>"bar"</code> the <em>default value</em> of <code>foo</code>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/06/removing-previously-printed-lines.html"/>
    <updated>2013-06-08T15:27:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/06/removing-previously-printed-lines</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote small <a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/tramtracker">Ruby Gem</a> that provides a command line interface to Melbourne&rsquo;s <a href="http://yarratrams.com.au/tramtracker">TramTracker service</a>.</p>

<p>One main feature I wanted was to allow the script to poll TramTracker on a regular basis.<br/>
In the past, I used the command line utility watch to achieve this, but I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to enforce a &ldquo;max iterations&rdquo; option.
If it gets forgotten about in the background, TramTracker will eventually block that IP address!</p>

<p>So I turned to Ruby. Now instead of printing the same block of text over and over again and filling up the terminal, I thought it would be better to just have that text overwrite itself in place.</p>

<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll outline a couple of ways of achieving this.</p>

<h2>Using the \b (backspace) character</h2>

<p>Printing a \b character does the same thing as pressing backspace. This is really simple to use and is great for little &ldquo;progress&rdquo; spinners.<br/>
For example, a character that cycles through <code>|</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>\</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;foo</span><span class="se">\b\b\b</span><span class="s2">bar&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; bar</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;|/-</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">chars</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">sleep</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\b</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; Cheesy, old-school spinner</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are two main shortfalls with this approach, one is that it only works on a single line and two is that if you want to overwrite lots of characters, you&rsquo;d need just as many <code>\b</code> characters (you would probably introduce a loop).</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;foo</span><span class="se">\n\b\b\b</span><span class="s2">bar&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; foo\nbar</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Using the \r (carriage return) character</h2>

<p>To avoid having to repeat just as many <code>\b</code> characters, a simple alternative would be to return the cursor to the start of the line and write over the top of the existing characters. For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="mi">100</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">times</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="nb">p</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\r</span><span class="s2">Downloading %</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">p</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">...&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nb">sleep</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This approach still won&rsquo;t work across multiple lines, but it has another subtle shortfall too, it doesn&rsquo;t clear the entire line. For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">&quot;foo</span><span class="se">\r</span><span class="s2">p&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1"># =&gt; poo</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A common work around for this is to pad the end of the string with spaces, but there are better ways (keep reading ;) )</p>

<h2>Using curses</h2>

<p>The most common answer to overwriting characters across multiple lines, is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)">curses</a>.
Curses allows you to pick exactly with character you want to update and makes <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=command+line+curses&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.47534661,d.aGc&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=679&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=r0WzUbyWF4T-iAfn8IH4DA">menu driven Text User Interfaces</a> (TUI&rsquo;s) easier to develop.
Ruby happens to have a <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/curses/rdoc/Curses.html">curses module</a> built in to its standard library, which provides a simple API, for example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="n">setpos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cols</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Start in the middle</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">addstr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I created a more complete (simple) example of using curses in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/stevenocchipinti/5703381">gist here</a>.</p>

<p>Curses is pretty good for this sort of stuff, it gives you a lot for free.
The thing that I didn&rsquo;t like about using the curses library was that when it initialises, it clears the screen.
This behaviour suits a TUI, and the old contents is still restored when you return, but I was being picky and didn&rsquo;t want that.</p>

<h2>Using individual cursor movement characters</h2>

<p>This last option is the most fundamental of the bunch. Terminals generally support characters that will allow you to move the cursor around at will and would be the basis of things like curses, although not as commonly used. Here are the most common characters to move the cursor around:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>

    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/05/safe-mode-on-samsung-galaxy-s3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had some trouble with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I&rsquo;m still not sure what caused it, but quite frequently, it would completely freeze up, even after a fresh reboot. It may have been a dodgy app, or something deeper in android, but in the process of fixing it, I was introduced to &ldquo;<em>safe mode</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Safe mode</em>&rdquo; here behaves like safe mode in Windows. It basically lets you use your phone just like normal, but without starting the usual plethora of background processes. You can still get to your settings, apps and files, but things won&rsquo;t start automatically.</p>

<p>To enter safe mode on the Galaxy S3 is really simple:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Restart the phone<br/>2. While it is booting up (and you see the Samsung logo),  <br/>   simply hold the volume down button</p></blockquote>


<p>When it boots, you should have the stock wallpaper, your shortcuts will be gone and you should see a little watermark in the bottom left corner that says &ldquo;<em>Safe mode</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-AJ8LJPOQQPM/UY8ZnFfsA-I/AAAAAAAABPM/4yaTDxpxyH8/Screenshot_2013-05-12-09-41-12.png"></p>

<p>From here you can do everything like normal, browse the net, make calls, etc. but more importantly, you can uninstall dodgy apps, change settings, even factory reset the device.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-17T12:13:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2013/03/how-to-make-tomato-sauce</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This time of year is &ldquo;tomato season&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s an Italian tradition of ours to spend a weekend together and make enough tomato sauce to last us the year. Of course, everyone does this differently, but here I&rsquo;ll outline how our family does it.</p>

<h2>1. Buy some &ldquo;sauce tomatoes&rdquo;</h2>

<p>If you go to any suburbs that have an Italian community you&rsquo;ll most probably see signs for people selling &ldquo;sauce tomatoes&rdquo;. Sauce tomatoes are normally more ripe than usual, which makes them ideal to turn into sauce. We bought 16 boxes of tomatoes from the local Italian social club.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-kLmW3G-M82k/UUUUgCR8bmI/AAAAAAAABIs/32XG7TXpzf0/s400/20130316_094831.jpg"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-J5tdH_9R4Z8/UUUU4RIw3CI/AAAAAAAABJc/ZygQmWXO5r4/s400/20130316_094840.jpg"></p>

<h2>2. Wash and cut the tomatoes</h2>

<p>This part is where most of the effort is spent!<br/>
We use large plastic tubs, fill them with two thirds water and empty some tomatoes in. We then pull out a tomato one by one, cut it in half and then cut the hard stem out from the middle, putting all the stems in the compost bin and the washed, cut tomatoes in another bucket. This makes it easier to mince later, but also gives us a chance to inspect the tomato to ensure the inside isn&rsquo;t rotten.<br/>
Rotten tomatoes are easy to spot, they are either black on the inside or they stink! If ever you&rsquo;re not sure, giving it a smell is normally the easiest way to tell &ndash; and <em>&ldquo;When in doubt, throw it out&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<h2>3. Pre-boil them if they are firm</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Sauce tomatoes&rdquo; are normally very ripe and soft, but sometimes they are quite firm. If this is the case they won&rsquo;t go through the mincer as well. So to help with this, we used a couple of large drums filled with water on a flame to lightly boil them a little. The idea is to only soften them up, so once the skin starts peeling off, you can pull them out of the water and drain them to remove as much as the water as possible (otherwise the sauce will be watery).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-3ysJI0FsWwM/UUUU10kcHzI/AAAAAAAABJU/xEjhXwc3AaA/s400/20130316_142524.jpg" title="Pre-boiling the tomatoes" ></p>

<h2>4. Mince the tomatoes</h2>

<p>Now that the tomatoes are soft, washed and cut they can be minced. We scoop out some tomatoes and put them in the mincer. The mincer will separate the tomato sauce from the skin and the seeds. We generally fill one tub at a time.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-YgmLdVOWIDw/UUUUqO6wThI/AAAAAAAABJE/5jfEGgAVXX4/s400/20130316_151435.jpg" title="The machine!" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-od8P9pb0908/UUUUlBKMtkI/AAAAAAAABI0/Ee81zN89xCA/s400/20130316_152105.jpg" title="Gently pushing the tomatoes down in to the mincer" ></p>

<h2>5. Second mince</h2>

<p>Once you have a (mostly) full tub of sauce, we actually put the left over skin and seed back through one more time and mix it with the rest of the sauce in the tub. This produces a thicker consistency and really gets the most out of the tomatoes. Be sure to mix the tub up well, otherwise the consistency will not be evenly spread.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-9oBg-HzFXvE/UUUUs-jYfqI/AAAAAAAABJM/pdz9BiY1uo4/s400/20130316_154702.jpg" title="The second run - putting the left overs back through one more time" ></p>

<h2>6. Bottling the sauce</h2>

<p>This year we used three different types of bottles: The usual large beer bottles with bottle caps, large jars with screw on lids and for the first time we tried using a few small (crown lager) beer bottles.<br/>
The first step is to put a spoon of salt and two basil leaves in each bottle, then fill the bottles with the sauce, leaving at least 5cm of an air gap from the top of the bottle.<br/>
Throughout the year, we collect up the beer bottles so we can re-use them for the next year. Be careful of this though, the bottles shouldn&rsquo;t be reused for more than about three times or so. Every time they are boiled, the bottles get weaker, so if they are reused too many times, they will eventually shatter when they are boiled.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-RadhwYybuNg/UUUUdfjqpuI/AAAAAAAABIk/CwYEz0gUd60/s400/20130316_154646.jpg" title="Filling the bottles with the sauce" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-L_qGUWCa8qY/UUUU7GU63MI/AAAAAAAABJk/Dv1e_zh49cs/s400/20130316_165043.jpg" title="The beer bottles we use for the sauce" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Hs6FLxazQ_0/UUUVEhXaXTI/AAAAAAAABJs/igdYDvmqMtw/s400/20130316_165038.jpg" title="The jars we use for the sauce" ></p>

<h2>7. Cap the bottles</h2>

<p>The jars with the screw on lids are the most risky. They need to be sealed tightly, otherwise they will not preserve correctly and will make a mess in the final stages. The beer bottles on the other hand are more reliable. You can buy bags of new bottle caps fairly cheaply and then using a &ldquo;capper&rdquo;, they normally seal quite well. Just be sure to check they are tight as you go.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-xDFjdPPwOAQ/UUUVIcmmNuI/AAAAAAAABJ0/V4-W_PAO6Wk/s400/20130316_165105.jpg" title="The 'capper'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-hH6Y62LyrLk/UUUEkP6h7qI/AAAAAAAABIU/SHBtwG2FsCs/s400/20130316_165116.jpg"></p>

<h2>8. Boil the bottles</h2>

<p>After the sauce bottles are all sealed and ready to go, they are gently placed in a drum where they are boiled. We generally put a blanket in the bottom of the barrel, then a layer of bottles standing upright, then another blanket, another layer of bottles, etc. Then fill the drum with water and turn the flame on. As this is a large volume to heat up, it takes quite a while to start to boil, but once the boiling and/or steaming has started, we keep the flame on for another two hours. It&rsquo;s very important that once they have boiled for two hours that you leave them in the water until the water goes cold &ndash; this could be a whole day. Taking them out too early can cause the bottles to shatter.<br/>
This process is what preserves and seals the bottles properly.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IiRcn9RxY1Q/UU14jO09XnI/AAAAAAAABKE/gzMGrDaoGWQ/s400/IMAG0281.jpg" title="Boiling the bottles to seal and preserve them" ></p>

<h2>9. Enjoy!</h2>

<p>After the water has gone cold, the bottles can be pulled out and put away. We try to make enough to last us a whole year, so we put them into crates, keep one crate in the kitchen and store the rest of them in a cool place.<br/>
When you want to use the sauce, it still needs to be cooked, so you can experiment with different recipes at the time &ndash; you can add your herbs, spices, wine, etc. and let it cook for anywhere between half an hour and two hours.</p>

<p>Now you know exactly what goes into your sauce, no preservatives and in my opinion, it tastes so much better than the ready made sauces from the shops that you&rsquo;ll never want to buy that stuff again!</p>

Every time I go on holiday, I end up writing the same bash script! &#8230; I know, how nerdy is that, I code on holidays.<br /><br />I really should save the script and bring it with me each time, instead I just re-invent the wheel everytime, so I thought I would write a quick post to record it for next time.<br />Luckily it&#8217;s a really simple script to write, all it does is move the photos from my camera&#8217;s memory card to the laptop HDD, but it puts them in a sub-directory for that particular day, then sorts the files into a &#8216;jpg&#8217; or &#8216;raw&#8217; sub-directory.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4453912.js"></script>The script is quite dumb, it just creates a directory for the current date. On one of the trips, I had the script pull the date the photo was taken from the EXIF information, but when a series of photos goes over mid-night, it splits them up and I didn&#8217;t really like that.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[A few photography tips]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/12/a-few-photography-tips.html"/>
    <updated>2012-12-14T13:44:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/12/a-few-photography-tips</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago, my brother got me a photography course as a gift, so I asked a friend of mine, Amy, to join me and last Thursday night we attended the course. The course was a &ldquo;Night Landscape&rdquo; tutorial where we all brought our own cameras and a professional photographer guides us through how to take photos at night. The class was quite small, it consisted of Amy and I with one other student.</p>

<p>The course started out quite basic and we went though some fundamental theory, a lot of which Amy and I already knew, but the other student was a little less experienced so the photographer needed to cater for all of us.<br/>
Luckily it was just a small class, because instead of following the standard course structure, the photographer spent more time in conversations with us, answering all our specific questions.</p>

<p>Being self-taught, I am grateful for that, because these conversations were what lead me to learn a few new things that I hadn&rsquo;t picked up in my own research so far.<br/>
Here is a quick summary of the things I learned:</p>

<h2>1. Blowing out the sky, intentionally</h2>

<p>The first new tip I learned was a trick the photographer used when the scene has an unusable sky, such as a dull cloud cover (like last night in the rain). He would take another photo that was intentionally over-exposed so the sky was as white as possible. By doing this, afterwards in Photoshop a pure white sky is very easy to select, even through the leaves of a tree or someone&rsquo;s hair using tools like the magic wand, or a color-based selection and can be replaced with a more dramatic sky from another shoot.</p>

<h2>2. Hand-holding at night</h2>

<p>At night, it is normally quite hard to take photos without blurring the shot unless you have a tripod, but there is a simple rule of thumb that can help with selecting an appropriate shutter speed:</p>

<blockquote><p>Make the denominator of the shutter speed match the focal length</p></blockquote>


<p>So if you are shooting at a 20mm focal length, the shutter speed should be about 1/20. Of course, this isn&rsquo;t a perfect rule, but it is a great place to start and you can adjust from there.</p>

<h2>3. Freezing human motion</h2>

<p>So the previous tip will make it easy to minimize any blur from yourself when holding the camera, but that wont help with people in your shot moving around. Well this photographer recommends:</p>

<blockquote><p>Use a shutter speed of 1/125 as a baseline to freeze human motion</p></blockquote>


<p>It turns out that most movement from people is slow enough for this shutter speed to capture it sharply, and of course you can adjust as necessary.</p>

<h2>4. Filters to allow for more creativity</h2>

<p>So far the only filters I have used are a &ldquo;Circular Polariser&rdquo; to enhance sky&rsquo;s, cut out reflections, etc. and a &ldquo;UV&rdquo; filter to protect the lens. Our photographer had quite an impressive set of filters and gave us a demo of his &ldquo;Neutral Density&rdquo; (or &ldquo;ND&rdquo;) filter and a &ldquo;Graduated Blue-Yellow&rdquo; filter.<br/>
Long exposures can look really good at night, but they are normally impossible during the day, but with the ND filter, not much light gets through, so long exposures are needed even during the day. Our photographer had a street art photo with blurred clouds and deep dark colors in the middle of the day &ndash; it looked fantastic!<br/>
The &ldquo;Graduated Blue-Yellow&rdquo; filter changes the color of the light that comes through, and in this case, it enhances the blue colors of a sky at the top of the shot and the earthy yellow tones of the ground on the bottom of the shot. I had only ever known these colors to be improved like this with the use of software, but these filters had a great effect straight from the camera.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>So at the end of the day, the course was quite basic, but in our tangential conversations I gained some pretty cool tips and tricks.<br/>
I think the most valuable aspect of a course like this is not so much the material presented, but just to experience another photographers style. It&rsquo;s always interesting to see how everyone thinks about things in their own unique way, and going through other peoples photos with a conversation is really intriguing.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rob and Sarah for the gift and Amy for keeping me company!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/10/bluetooth-audio-streaming-from-phone-to.html"/>
    <updated>2012-10-30T11:27:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/10/bluetooth-audio-streaming-from-phone-to</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was toying with the idea of making my own &ldquo;Car Computer&rdquo; and one of the crucial parts is a Bluetooth connection, but not for P2P file transfer (although that could be useful), I would want this computer to appear the same way a Bluetooth stereo or headset does, so once connected it will stream the audio from my phone through the car speakers. Turns out it&rsquo;s quite easy with Ubuntu :)</p>

<p>PulseAudio is pretty awesome!<br/>
First step is ensure Pulse has the Bluetooth module loaded (mine did by default), you can check this by looking at this file <code>/etc/pulse/default.pa</code></p>

<p>The next step is to configure the Bluetooth daemon to enable <code>Source</code> (and/or <code>Gateway</code> mode).<br/>
To do this, I added the following line to <code>/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>/etc/bluetooth/audio.conf </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nv">Enable</span><span class="o">=</span>Gateway,Source,Socket
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then restart the Bluetooth daemon:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$&gt; sudo service bluetooth restart</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you&rsquo;ll have to pair the computer with the phone as per normal.<br/>
Once the devices are paired, an <code>Audio Source</code> connection needs to be created.<br/>
For this, the easiest way is via DBus, but so we don&rsquo;t have to write a script, an easy way to test this in an ad-hoc manner is to use a tool called <code>d-feet</code>, which is available in the Ubuntu repos.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$&gt; sudo apt-get install d-feet</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Using <code>d-feet</code>, navigate to the <code>system bus</code> and find the <code>org.bluez</code> key.<br/>
In here, there will be another key that has a device number in it.<br/>
(for me this was <code>/org/bluez/1002/hci0/dev_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx_xx</code>)<br/>
Under this key, execute <code>org.bluez.AudioSource &gt; methods &gt; Connect()</code> without any parameters and your phone should now indicate that it is connected to the computer as an audio device.</p>

<p>At this point, I started playing some music so I could tell when it was working, but you probably won&rsquo;t be able to hear anything just yet.<br/>
That is because Pulse does not automatically send every source to every output &ndash; that could get messy!<br/>
To configure pulse to send the audio from the Bluetooth connection to your speakers you need to determine the name of the audio source and the name of the &ldquo;<em>sink</em>&rdquo; (or output) and join them together.<br/>
You can do this with the PulseAudio shell like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$&gt; pacmd
</span><span class='line'>&gt;&gt;&gt; list-sources
</span><span class='line'>&gt;&gt;&gt; list-sinks
</span><span class='line'>&gt;&gt;&gt; load-module module-loopback source=bluez_source.xxxx sink=alsa_output.pci-xxxx</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(Replace the <code>source=</code> and <code>sink=</code> parts with the names from the preceding two commands)</p>

<p>Now all audio from your phone should be streaming through your computer.<br/>
DBus makes it really simple to do this programmatically, so it could easily be (mostly) automated and even controlled by a nice touch friendly GUI to pick the source device, etc.</p>

<p>I thought I would write up a quick post on this because when I finally got my music streaming through my laptop, it was exciting to know that I could actually use this to make a car computer with bluetooth functionality quite easily.<br/>
I used <code>AudioSource</code> in this example, but the other fun option is the <code>HandsFreeGateway</code>, where instead of streaming stereo sound for music, it will also connect the microphone from the computer to the phone to be used in-call, etc.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-11T13:29:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/09/getting-started-with-ruby-on-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Ruby on Rails for about a year and half now and I&rsquo;m really enjoying it! At the time of writing (at least in Melbourne) there is lots of demand for Rubyist&rsquo;s, so it&rsquo;s great time to get involved.<br/>
I have a couple of friends who are interested in making the switch from Java to Ruby so I wrote them an email with some pointers on how to get started and then realized it would make a good blog post :)</p>

<h2>Join the community!</h2>

<p>Ruby and Rails are quite well known for their excellent communities, so the first step is to join your local group. For us in Australia, that group is <em>Ruby On Rails Oceania</em> (aka RORO).<br/>
They have meetups on the <em>last Thursday of every month</em> in Melbourne and a pretty active mailing list:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#%21forum/rails-oceania">Ruby On Rails Oceania Mailing List</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ruby.org.au/">Ruby.org.au</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Ruby and Rails resources:</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a> &ndash; I use these almost everyday!</li>
<li><a href="http://apidock.com/">ApiDock</a> &ndash; API&rsquo;s for Ruby, Rails and RSpec in one place</li>
<li><a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails For Zombies</a> &ndash; A great beginners tutorial for rails</li>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">Rails Casts</a> &ndash; Regular video podcast all about rails</li>
<li><a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/">Ruby5</a> &ndash; Regular 5 minute audio podcast on the latest news</li>
<li>&hellip; a plethora of good books, such as &ldquo;The RSpec Book&rdquo;, &ldquo;Design Patterns in Ruby&rdquo;, etc. (alot of which I still need to read)</li>
</ul>


<h2>Getting started:</h2>

<p>To get started you&rsquo;ll need to set up your development environment, here&rsquo;s what I use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vim&hellip; of course&hellip; although there are lots of alternatives, the most popular ones would probably be:

<ul>
<li>RubyMine (IDE) &ndash; used alot at work (commercial software)</li>
<li>Sublime Text 2 (Text editor)</li>
<li>TextMate (Text editor)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RVM (Ruby Version Manager)

<ul>
<li>Get from here: <a href="https://rvm.io/">https://rvm.io</a></li>
<li>Follow the instructions to configure your shell to use RVM</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use RVM to install the latest ruby

<ul>
<li><code>rvm install 1.9.3</code></li>
<li>A newer alternative to RVM is RBenv</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you have ruby installed, you will have the &lsquo;gem&rsquo; command available

<ul>
<li>Gems are roughly equivalent to jars in the Java world</li>
<li>Use gem to install the latest rails

<ul>
<li><code>gem install rails</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you have rails installed, you will have the &lsquo;rails&rsquo; command available

<ul>
<li>Use the rails command to start a new project

<ul>
<li><code>rails new todolist</code></li>
<li><code>rails server</code></li>
<li>browse to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now you can read the readme, the rails guides and make a simple app with scaffolding!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Things to keep in mind for RoR dev:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rails is just a framework written in Ruby, so it will help to learn some straight Ruby too.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">ruby-lang.org</a> is a good place to start</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails strongly supports DRY principles

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel, theres problably a gem that already does what you want</li>
<li>To find gems, good places to look are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ruby-toolbox.com/">Ruby-Toolbox.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rubygems.org/">RubyGems.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The majority of Ruby projects are:

<ul>
<li>Developed using TDD/BDD, so you&rsquo;ll need to learn the testing frameworks:

<ul>
<li>Test::Unit (default with rails)</li>
<li>RSpec (a popular replacement for Test::Unit)</li>
<li>Cucumber (BDD)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developed on MacOSX &ndash; for new comers (like myself) some essentials are:

<ul>
<li>brew &ndash; a mac package manager (like apt or yum)</li>
<li>iterm2 &ndash; really good terminal emulator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deployed on Linux

<ul>
<li>Basic Linux foo is really useful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Version controlled with git

<ul>
<li>If you need to learn git, I highly recommend <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Pro git</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s a quick overview of what I can recommend to get going based on my own experience, things will obviously change over time, and others may have other opinions, if so feel free to leave comments below.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/samsung-galaxy-s3.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-21T12:50:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/samsung-galaxy-s3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
At the end of June this year, I upgraded from a HTC Desire HD to a Samsung Galaxy S3, so I thought after a couple of months of having my new phone I should write up a (really long) post on what stood out for me.<br /><br /><br /><b>The positive</b> <br /><br />The <b>screen and form factor</b> is awesome! Due to the plastic body and the thin shape, this phone is really light and slips into your pocket nicely. The massive 4.8&#8221; screen really shines when watching videos and browsing the web. I regularly watch screencasts on my phone and the 1280x720 resolution gives me plenty of detail. The colour contrast is a lot higher than my previous phone, which makes the blacks look really deep and videos stand out nicely. The marketing video that the phone comes with does demo it off quite well!<br /><br />The <b>battery </b>is fairly good. My requirement for battery life is that I can use it all day and by the time I get home / go to bed, it hasn&#8217;t died. Not a high expectation, I know, but these days its hard to expect more. This phone meets that requirement quite easily. On the days I don&#8217;t use my phone much, I get home after a days work with more than 50% remaining (which is huge compared to my last phone!) and on the days I use it quite heavily, I get home to about 30%-40% which easily lasts me the rest of the night. My usage generally includes syncing gmail, facebook, twitter, weather, RSS reader, work email (during peak hours), I am generally connected to wifi most of the time and I regularly browse the web and watch videos / listen to podcasts during my commute.<br /><br />The general<b> responsiveness</b> is miles ahead of my last phone too! Day-to-day usage is smooth and rarely experience any lag. This will be improved even more when Jellybean is released (rumoured to be soon!).<br /><br /><b>&#8220;Smart Stay&#8221; </b>is a new innovative feature from Samsung where just before the screen is about to timeout and turn off, the phone will take a photo of you with the front-facing camera and use face (or eye) detection to work out if you&#8217;re still looking at it. If you are, it will keep it on for another minute or so, if you&#8217;re not, then it will dim the screen and check again soon after, which then will actually turn it off.<br />This is to avoid that randomly-scrolling-to-avoid-the-screen-turning-off trick that most people will do when reading a long article. Thankfully, this feature is quite effective and I haven&#8217;t needed to do that for a while, although it doesn&#8217;t work very well in the dark!<br /><br />In the settings, there is a section called <b>&#8220;Motion&#8221;</b>. I won&#8217;t go through all of the options, as there are about 10 different ones, but some are quite handy. By far the best one IMHO is <b>&#8220;Direct call&#8221;</b>, which lets you directly call a contact whose call log details, contact details or message details are displayed on the screen by simply putting the phone to your ear from that screen. Feels very natural.<br />Another nice one is <b>&#8220;Smart alert&#8221;</b>, which will give a little vibration when you pick it up from a stationary location if you have a missed call or sms.<br /><br />The <b>camera</b> on this phone is not too bad either. Obviously it will never replace my dSLR, but it has some nice features that even my dSLR doesn&#8217;t have. The burst fire mode is really quick, but Samsung have introduced a feature called <b>&#8220;best shot&#8221;</b>, which will analyse each of the photos you took in the burst and pick the ones it thinks turned out the best, based on focus and face detection. You can adjust what was picked, and then the others are automatically discarded (saves you having to go through the 14 bad ones and delete them later).<br />The camera has a <b>built-in HDR</b> mode which works quite well too and the <b>photo editor</b> provides heaps of enhancements and corrections, including red-eye reduction, color balance, cropping, etc.<br /><br />Another nice feature is found in the video player, it has a <b>&#8220;pop-out&#8221;</b> button! This means that if you&#8217;re in the middle of a video and you wanted to quickly google something, or reply to an sms, you can just pop out the video, which turns the full screen player into a small, floating, always on top window that you can drag around, do what you need to do, and then make it full screen again. Not something that I&#8217;ve needed to use very often, but on the rare occasion I have, it&#8217;s been quite nice.<br /><br />I use my calendar religiously and on my older HTC, the default app looked nice, but didn&#8217;t have many features. I ended up swapping it out for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=netgenius.bizcal&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Business Calendar Free</a> just so I could get a month view with text, instead of indicators.<br />The stock Samsung calendar, <b>S Planner</b>, however is not too bad! It integrates with their S Memo, which I don&#8217;t use, but comes with a good number of viewing options, my favourites being their month view and analogue week view. It also has a nice <b>&#8220;Quick add&#8221; </b>feature that lets you enter &#8220;Dinner at Nandos tomorrow 7:30pm&#8221; and it does what you&#8217;d expect. This doesn&#8217;t support anywhere near as much as Google Calendar does, but its better than nothing!<br /><br />I lashed out and bought an <b>official Samsung Desktop Dock</b>, and comparing this to my cheap eBay special I bought for my HTC, not only does it look quite nice, but it automatically launches the desktop clock app when I dock it and after 5 minutes it dims the screen and hides the other UI elements other than the clock. I like this feature a lot because I otherwise don&#8217;t have a clock in my room, so its really handy for me!<br /><br /><br />As with all things, there are pro&#8217;s and con&#8217;s. Here are some of the things I don&#8217;t like. <br /><br /><br /><b>The negative</b><br /><br />Android have decided to <b>remove USB Mass Storage mode</b> (my biggest pet hate with Android right now!) This leaves you with 3 alternative options for copying files to and from the device: Media Transfer Protocol (MTP), Camera mode or using an app such as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.swift.app.kiesair&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Kies Air</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xcxin.filexpert&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInhjeGluLmZpbGV4cGVydCJd" target="_blank">File Expert</a>.<br />MTP and Camera mode both don&#8217;t give you access to all the directories on the phone, but for just transferring media it should be ok. Note that MTP will work out of the box with Windows, but if you run Mac or Linux like me, you will need to install software to get it to work (and Linux is a pain for this!).<br />The reason for this change is because USB Mass Storage mode will mean you have to unmount the partition from the system in order to mount it to the computer, whereas MTP will allow you to access it in both places at once, but its slower and requires software.<br />For phones like the Galaxy Nexus, this makes sense as there is only one partition, but with the S3, I would like to see the option of just unmounting the memory card (with is separate from the system storage) and allow that to work with USB Mass Storage mode.<br /><br />Another annoying thing I have found with this phone is sometimes the <b>home screen will randomly die</b>. This causes lag while all the widgets reinitialise themselves. It doesn&#8217;t happen often, but when it does, its annoying considering its a simple software issue. Hopefully this is fixed with Jellybean release!<br /><br />On a related note, I find the random delay between pressing the <b>unlock button</b> and the screen actually turning on to be annoying too, considering my older HTC was basically instantaneous everytime, this phone seems to vary quite a lot. I find myself pressing the button while its still in my pocket, just so by the time I have it in front of me, the screen is ready.<br /><br />A couple of other minor things include the <b>notification LED</b> being really bright, which is ok, but while the phone is docked my bedside, it will light up the entire room quite easily. This is kind of funny considering &#8220;smart stay&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work well at night. Maybe instead of just green and red, the LED should have also included an IR LED for that.<br />Not only is the LED really bright, but when the battery becomes fully charged, it will turn on the screen and popup a notification, which is also not very nice when I&#8217;m trying to sleep.<br />I know most of you are probably thinking a solution would be to turn it off at night, but I <a href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/03/xkcd-beyondpod.html" target="_blank">scheduled my phone to download podcasts</a> during these hours with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">BeyondPod</a> - I think the pro&#8217;s outweigh the con&#8217;s in this situation.<br /><br />Also minor, but there is <b>no stock flashlight app</b>, which I wanted to put in the lock screen shortcuts. It does come with a 2x1 widget, but to get a shortcut on the lock screen, I ended up downloading one of the million flashlight apps out there.<br /><br />Speaking of widgets, the HTC widgets were really nice, but I find the <b>widgets</b> that came with the Samsung are not quite as useful, luckily they are in abundance on the play store too!<br /><br /><br /><b>The other stuff</b><br /><br />Here are some other noteworthy things which I haven&#8217;t really made up my mind if I like yet or not.<br /><br />The music player has a feature called <b>&#8220;Music Square&#8221;</b> and I love the idea of it, but I&#8217;m not sure how effective it is. Basically you index your music library and it categorises each of your songs into 2 scales: <i>&#8216;Exciting</i> to <i>Calm&#8217;</i> and <i>&#8216;Passionate</i> to <i>Joyful</i>&#8217;. These two scales make up the axes of the music square and by tapping where your mood is will play those types of songs. It&#8217;s a great idea and I need to experiment with it more to see how effective it is.<br /><br />A lot of the features in the phone are <b>voice activated</b>. For example, you can say <i>&#8216;answer&#8217;</i> or <i>&#8216;reject&#8217;</i> when it is ringing (as long as the ringtone isn&#8217;t too loud); <i>&#8216;snooze&#8217;</i> or <i>&#8216;stop&#8217;</i> when the alarm is going off (as long as thats not too loud); <i>&#8216;smile&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;cheese&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;capture&#8217;</i> or <i>&#8216;shoot&#8217;</i> to take a photo (as long as your close enough for the phone to hear you); <i>&#8216;next&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;previous&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;pause&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;play&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;volume&#8217;</i>, etc. to control your music or the radio (as long as thats not too loud either).<br />As you can see, the usefulness of these features are dependant on the environment.<br /><br /><b>S Voice</b> is Samsung&#8217;s answer to Siri, and even the UI&#8217;s look similar, but while its great in theory, I think the most useful thing about Siri on the iPhone or S Voice on the Galaxy would be SMS/email dictation, but that is the one thing these features don&#8217;t work that well for, at least for me anyway - maybe its just my voice!<br /><br /><br /><b>The conclusion</b><br /><br />In the end I am very happy with my new phone, it is leaps and bounds above my old phone, its really responsive other than the random home screen lag and unlock button delay, it has some nice new innovative features and is a joy to use.<br />Also, with the Jellybean release (hopefully) around the corner, it can only get better.

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Adding a network printer in Ubuntu 12.04]]></title>
    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/adding-network-printer-in-ubuntu-1204.html"/>
    <updated>2012-08-05T04:11:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/08/adding-network-printer-in-ubuntu-1204</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the old days, printing was really hard in linux. It was one of the things that was a deal breaker when trying to switch from Windows for a lot of people, but when I first tried Ubuntu (probably around 2006-2007) it made all that pain go away! It was easy! A couple of clicks and you could set up a network printer and its been that easy ever since.</p>

<p>Recently Ubuntu have tried to make their settings screen a bit like a Mac, and to simplify everything they seem to be using a simplified user interface for the printer configuration too:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bx9JrDkVYrk/UB3w_5N77aI/AAAAAAAAAKY/5HHdw8ZErB0/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:37.png" title="New Settings user interface" >
<img class="center" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xO2uGM8R36A/UB3xME_iwZI/AAAAAAAAAKg/kBFbC_MDcv8/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14:04:55.png" title="New Printing user interface" ></p>

<p>Well this new interface doesn&rsquo;t work for me, when I try to add a network printer, I get the error message:</p>

<blockquote><p>FirewallD is not running. Network printer detection needs services mdns, ipp, ipp-client and samba-client enabled on firewall.</p></blockquote>


<p><img class="center" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FTpSMga_I2I/UB3xOZVzlDI/AAAAAAAAAKo/4_KILPWTWTg/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A03%253A44.png" title="The error that stops me from finding my network printer" ></p>

<p>Well no matter what I did, I couldn&rsquo;t add my printer. After some googling around, I found how to get to the old user interface&hellip; which actually works!
Just type this into a terminal:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sudo system-config-printer</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And you will be given this old familiar screen:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SnoWmsgEnX0/UB3xQWJYmhI/AAAAAAAAAK4/LCbtVTqQFZE/Screenshot+from+2012-08-05+14%253A04%253A55.png" title="The classic printing user interface... the one that works!" ></p>

<p>Clicking the big &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button in this screen and following the steps worked great for me. Another alternative is to use the CUPS web interface on <a href="http://localhost:631">http://localhost:631</a> but that can be a little more complicated.</p>

    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/07/arduino-web-server-with-sd-card-reader</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve had an interest in electronics since a very young age, but I never really went further than building simple circuits as a kid and learning the theory and following diagrams through school.<br/>
There&rsquo;s always the odd repair job, and plenty of theoretical knowledge from family, friends and university, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to design the electronics of anything complex.</p>

<p>A little while back, a <a href="http://michael.chandler.id.au/">friend of mine</a> got an email from <a href="http://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> with suggested meetups. One of them was the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hackduino-Electronics-Meetup-Group">Melbourne Hackduino</a> meetup.<br/>
So he forwarded it on to our group of friends and a few of us went along to check it out. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to play with a microprocessor, but never really put the time aside for it. Being a software developer there was always this barrier between the programs I write and making them do something in the real world.</p>

<p>Well, in the last week that barrier has been lifted! The meetup was great and hearing about other people&rsquo;s hobbies and projects provides plenty of motivation! We heard stories about everything from people trying to optimize solar hot water systems to building full size mechanical avatars. It was a lot of fun!</p>

<p><a href="http://au.linkedin.com/pub/mark-butt/28/507/539">Mark Butt</a>, the organiser of the event gave us a presentation of <a href="http://www.springrocket.com.au/portfolio/">some of the cool things he has done in the past</a>, such as an arduino powered bar counter top that detects what drink you put on it and a run down of some of the things he plans on doing in the future, all very cool!</p>

<p>One really nice bonus was the generous offering from <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/">Freetronics</a>. There were a few people from Freetronics at the event and other than being very knowledgeable, they brought a big bunch of assorted hardware to give away! They had everything from RGB LEDs to full blown Arduino boards.<br/>
I was lucky enough to score an <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/products/ethermega-arduino-mega-2560-compatible-with-onboard-ethernet#.UA3bC3AwyGo">EtherMega 2650</a>, which from what I can tell is a beefed up Arduino with an Ethernet port (with power over Ethernet) and a MicroSD card reader. Some of my friends got a <a href="http://www.freetronics.com/products/lcd-keypad-shield#.UA4RrXAwyGp">LCD shield</a> that can display 2 rows of 16 characters and has a few buttons on board. For those that aren&rsquo;t up with the lingo, a shield is an attachment for a standard Arduino board to add functionality.</p>

<p>Together we had enough hardware to be able to make something cool! :&ndash;)<br/>
Needless to say after some great conversations about hardware hacking and being given some gear to get going, we were all pretty keen to get started hacking, so on the following Saturday three of us got together for a hack night.<br/>
The guys came around that night, we ordered pizzas and worked through the night till about 5:30 AM!   We had one experienced hardware guy, <a href="https://twitter.com/asellitt">@asellitt</a>, but the other two of us, <a href="https://twitter.com/optiks">@optiks</a> and I, were completely new to this, but between Anthony, the sample code that comes with the IDE and the Internet we picked it up pretty fast!<br/>
By the end of the night we had the first version of CarDuino!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/HACD/CarDuino">CarDuino</a> is a simple game where you hold the screen in portrait orientation and move your car from side to side to avoid obstacles.  It&rsquo;s a very simple game, and we have plenty more features in mind for the future, but it was a great first project!</p>

<p>After sleeping in till about lunch time there next day, I wanted to put my EtherMega to use, so I spent the rest of the day fiddling with that.   With network access, power over Ethernet and a card reader, this is a perfect platform for controlling things via a web interface. As my background is web development, this was right up my alley!   Using various sample code, I put together a <a href="https://github.com/stevenocchipinti/ArduinoWebServer">really basic web server</a> that can respond to different requests and serve files from its built in memory card reader.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ezXsvJSsgHc/UAvmjO-JnGI/AAAAAAAAAKE/oZ6v5viAgzQ/20120722_213551.png" title="My Freetronics EtherMega 2560 serving files from the memory card on a webserver!" ></p>

<p>In just a few days, we went from no Arduino experience to a working project (or two). Especially with basic programming experience, the entry level for getting into Arduino is really low. When you buy (or build) a board and download the software, you have enough sample code with the IDE to make things happen, and you can get a lot done by simply copying and pasting!</p>

<p>I recommend having a play with this stuff, its really fun and more than likely, one day you will come across a problem that you will be able to solve with an Arduino!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/05/google-calendar-repeating-event-on-last.html"/>
    <updated>2012-05-23T12:19:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/05/google-calendar-repeating-event-on-last</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I regularly attend <a href="http://ruby.org.au/">RORO &ndash; The Ruby on Rails Oceania</a> meetups.
They currently occur on the last Thursday of every month and so naturally I put the event in my calendar. I added the usual details and then selected the &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; option and set it to repeat monthly by the day of the week.</p>

<p>This worked well for a while, until one day when I rocked up and it wasn&rsquo;t on.<br/>
A later realised that in that particular month there were 5 Thursdays instead of 4 and my calendar event was actually set to repeat <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the fourth Thursday&rdquo;</em>.<br/>
It turns out that the interface Google provide to set recurring events does not allow you to change this.. or at least not intuitively.</p>

<p>After some searching around I found a few solutions:</p>

<h2>Use English!</h2>

<p>The simplest way is to just write out the event in plain English. For example:</p>

<blockquote><p>RORO at Inspire9, Richmond on the last Thursday of every month</p></blockquote>


<p>This will create an event called &ldquo;RORO at Inspire9, Richmond&rdquo;, with the location field set to &ldquo;Inspire9, Richmond&rdquo; and the repetition set to <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the last Thursday&rdquo;.</em></p>

<h2>Start repeating from an appropriate month</h2>

<p>Another fairly easy way is to find a month that actually has 5 Thursdays and make the event start from there. This will set the recurrence to repeat <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the last Thursday&rdquo;</em>, instead of <em>&ldquo;Monthly on the fourth Thursday&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<h2>Hack the ICS</h2>

<p>This solution is probably the hardest, but because the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> format does support this, you could write the code manually. To do this you would have to export the calendar to a file, hack it and import it back.<br/>
While it&rsquo;s nice to know this, seems like more effort that just typing what you want in English!</p>

<h2>A better solution</h2>

<p>.. would be if Google provided an additional option in the little &ldquo;repeat&rdquo; popup to allow this!</p>

<p>Or maybe the RORO organiser should maintain there own calendar feed that we could all subscribe to. This would also mean that if a particular meetup was moved or cancelled, all the subscribers calendars would automatically be updated!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/05/password-management.html"/>
    <updated>2012-05-16T13:46:00+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2012/05/password-management</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div>Password management is one of those things that can always be improved. If anyone is using a single password for all their accounts in this day and age they are most likely going to experience trouble at some stage! This post is to outline my progression through some approaches I&#8217;ve tried starting from a very young age to present day.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #1: A tiered approach</b><br /><br />For me, the natural progression from a single password (back in primary school) was to go with a tiered approach. I used one password for for the basic sites, spam, etc. - the stuff I don&#8217;t really care about very much. I used another password for the important stuff, like Facebook, Twitter, etc. and this password was a lot stronger than the last. I had a unique and strong password for my email, as someone with access to that would most likely have the power to reset any of my other passwords. And finally I had a completely separate password for banking.<br /><br />While this system is ok, it&#8217;s not the best! Once upon a time, way back before I could touch type, I came to a password prompt, so I looked down at the keyboard, typed out my password, pressed enter and looked back up at the screen. In that time a friend had sent me an IM on MSN messenger (I know, old school!) and the chat window had stolen focus, so I sent my password to him. While I (mostly) trust my friend, in a panic, I frantically raced around to as many sites as I could to change the password to something else.<br /><br />If I had a different password for each site, this wouldn&#8217;t have been a problem. Now obviously most people wouldn&#8217;t IM their passwords to their friends, but there are lots of other ways for your passwords to get out. A few simple examples are the &#8220;Anonymous&#8221; attacks on large systems like the PSN, keyloggers, people looking over your shoulder, phishing attacks and even <a href="http://plaintextoffenders.com/" target="_blank">stupid websites</a> making dumb mistakes! Of course, this isn&#8217;t even thinking about what would happen if you were the target of a good hacker! &#8230; but that&#8217;ll never happen right? ;)<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #2: Patterned alterations</b><br /><br />Ok, so if I want a different password for every site I will ever use, how will I ever remember all of them. Well one simple way would be to make careful alterations to the password based on a pattern. This pattern should not be obvious by looking at a given password, but it should be reproducible based on whatever site you are trying to log in to. For example, if your normal password is &#8216;P@$sW0rd&#8217;, one pattern could produce &#8217;<u>T</u>@$sW<u>#Er</u>&#8217; for when you&#8217;re trying to log in to <u>T</u>witt<u>er</u> and &#8221;<u>F</u>@$sW<u>#Ok</u>&#8221; for when you&#8217;re trying to log in to <u>F</u>acebo<u>ok</u>.<br />I&#8217;m sure you can guess the pattern here. Everyone will have their own unique twist on patterns and this can be quite successful if executed correctly, but of course if your pattern is weak and a real person gets your Facebook password of &#8220;P@sS-facebook&#8221;, they can probably guess your twitter password would be &#8220;P@sS-twitter&#8221;.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #3: Stored, centralised and synchronised passwords</b><br /><br />Alot of people think that letting your browser remember passwords is a bad thing, and while it does have particular cons, there are some pros to it too.<br />For one, you can have completely random passwords and not have to remember them. Also, two of the methods of disclosing a password that I mentioned earlier were keyloggers and someone looking over your shoulder. Both of these scenarios are a lot less likely if your browser does the typing for you (but of course there are other considerations with this approach). The obvious con would be that if someone gets a hold of what the browser knows, they have <i>all</i> your passwords!<br /><br />Firefox provides a &#8220;master password&#8221; facility to encrypt all your passwords (one of my pet hates is that Chrome lacks this) so when a password is needed, you type in your master password once, and it will then autofill any field after that. (Just remember to lock your screen if you leave your pc unattended).<br />Special consideration to make this password super strong should obviously be taken to avoid any brute force possibilities and of course a master password can be stolen just the same, but this password is useless online and it reduces the probability of others being stolen. (1 chance to steal the master password, as opposed to many chances to steal individual passwords).<br /><br />Now throw Firefox Sync into the mix. Now all your encrypted passwords are in the cloud and available on any machine running Firefox. I found this to be really handy, but it represents its own risks. This is also just limited to Firefox, what about mobile browsers? What about Chrome or your friends computer?<br />Again, not a perfect solution, but not too bad either.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #4: Personal vault</b><br /><br />Some really paranoid people will say &#8220;But what if Mozilla aren&#8217;t encrypting your passwords properly?&#8221;, or &#8220;I don&#8217;t trust other people to store my passwords regardless of encryption&#8221;. Well, in that case, if you want to store all your random passwords, and ensure they are encrypted, you could always do it yourself.<br />I played with a nifty command line tool called &#8221;<a href="https://github.com/janlelis/pws" target="_blank">PWS</a>&#8221; and its open source so you can see exactly how they secure your passwords. The beauty about this method is that you are in complete control. For example, I could use a central repo to store my encrypted passwords and keep this synchronised across all machines, and if I don&#8217;t want to check out the repo (say, on a friends computer), I could just SSH to my VPS where I could get the password. It doesn&#8217;t fill forms in browsers, but it will copy the password to the clipboard for 10 seconds so you can just paste it in the browser (which is vulnerable to clipboard monitoring software/viruses).<br />It even has a random password generator for new sites. <br />While this method is great for paranoid people, its lacking a lot of features I would expect.<br /><br /><br /><b>Attempt #5: Hosted password services</b><br /><br />If you were to combine the best parts of the previous methods, you would get a hosted service that provides browser plugins for form filling on any browser, is centralised and synchronised across all machines, is encrypted with a master password, has an easy way to pull out any existing passwords from a &#8220;vault&#8221; and makes it simple to sign up for new sites with a unique random password.<br />As it turns out there are quite a few of these services available, such as 1Password and LastPass.<br /><br /></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" target="_blank">1Password</a> is quite popular, especially among Mac users and provides clients for Mac, Windows, iPhones, Androids, etc. The interface is quite polished (as you could have guessed) but it costs about $50 for a Mac licence (or $70 if you want to use it on Windows and Mac). One feature that a lot people like is that you can choose where you would like to store the passwords, for example using dropbox to synchronise across machines, but personally I don&#8217;t think that provides any real advantage.</div><div></div><div></div><div><a href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a> is very similar in terms of features, but they host your encrypted passwords for you and it is free! They have plugins and clients for almost every conceivable device, but the only catch is that if you want to use the mobile browser plugins, you need a premium account, which costs $12 per year.<br /><br />I&#8217;ve been using LastPass for a little while now and one thing I like the configurable random password generator. You can choose just how complex the generated passwords are by configuring length and character set. When you sign up for a new site, you can generate a ramdom password with one click and it will get entered into the site&#8217;s form and saved in your vault for future. It can fill in standard forms with your personal details (name, email address, etc.) It is accessible anyway by logging into the web interface and its all secured using a master password, which I recommend using a super strong passphrase for, something in the order of 20-30 characters would be good. Remember if someone can log in here, they can get everything!<br /><br />Another layer of protection is using 2 factor authentication. They have a few varieties for this, but the one I like is the Google Authenticator method. Basically when ever a new device is used to attempt to log in with your account, either using a plugin, app or just the website, they will need to provide the email address, the password and a token. To get this token I configured the Google Authenticator app on my Android, which means that even if someone was to somehow get my super strong master password, they would also need my phone before they can do anything.<br />I use this approach on my Gmail account too, but Gmail&#8217;s 2 factor authentication uses SMS&#8217;s instead of the Google Authenticator app.<br /><br /><br /><b>Conclusion</b><br /><br />So far I am pretty happy with LastPass. I now type in my super strong master password once a day and the rest is filled automatically. Signing up to new sites is a breeze and uses a completely random and unique password per site. My passwords are available in Firefox and Chrome; in Linux, Mac or Windows and potentially for my mobile browsers too (if I decide to pay $1 per month). Not only is my master password really strong, but it is backed up with 2 factor authentication using my phone. I can even get to my passwords from a public computer via the web interface and my phone (without needing to go via dropbox or anything). Best of all, I get all this security and convenience with minimal effort and without paying a cent!</div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div><p>Today marks 1 year since my first blog post.<br>In that time I have written 40 posts and this site has received over 7000 views from all over the world!<br>I&#8217;ve had some great feedback (even from total strangers), which has been fantastic - It&#8217;s a good feeling to know that my ramblings can actually be useful for others too.</p><p>I started this blog because as a fairly technical person, I am constantly learning, but one of the caveats of this constant learning culture is that some people (such as myself) find it quite hard to remember all the cool stuff we pick up over the years, so this blog&#8217;s primary purpose was to act as a &#8221;<i>memory supplement</i>&#8221;.</p><p>The idea being that when you read something new, it will only stay in your head if you keep using it (or, unlike me, if you have a really good memory), but sometimes what ever it is that we just learned won&#8217;t be totally relevant or useful until much later. </p><p>One of the best ways that I have found to retain this knowledge is to use it! For example, if you are reading up on a new programming language, use it! Write little scripts, re-write other existing programs in this new language and just get used to using it regularly.<br>If this isn&#8217;t available (or suitable) I find talking about it with other like-minded people will reinforce the knowledge too. Alot of the time, you can really reinforce your knowledge of a topic by teaching it to someone else. Meetups and groups of like minded friends are great for this. </p><p>This is part of the reason I started this blog. Once I learn something new (that I have a desire to remember) I try to write up a quick blog post as soon as I can.<br>Not only does this reinforce my knowledge, but if I do happen to forget, instead of using Google to re-learn it, I can simply use my blog&#8217;s search to find my own post on the topic and has the convenience of being written in my own way of thinking/writing.<br>Even if my post is out-of-date, or not complete enough, it will still refresh my memory and give me a better foundation to start learning up on that particular topic once again. </p><p>This blog has served its purpose well and will continue to do so. If you have a similar way of thinking (or a similar memory) as me, I highly recommend starting a blog! </p><p>Thanks to everyone that has been reading so far! :-) </p></div>
